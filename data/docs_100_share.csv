27989839,Cilostazol and enzymatically modified isoquercitrin attenuate experimental colitis and colon cancer in mice by inhibiting cell proliferation and inflammation.,"We previously reported the anti-inflammatory effects of cilostazol, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 3, and two antioxidants, enzymatically modified isoquercitrin and √é¬±-lipoic acid in a dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis mouse model. We further examined the chemopreventive effects of these substances in a murine azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulphate -induced colorectal carcinoma model and compared the effects with those of the well-known anticancer natural plant pigment, anthocyanin. In addition, the effects on cell proliferation activity were evaluated in colon cancer cell lines and mucosal epithelial cells in a model of acute dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis. Cilostazol and enzymatically modified isoquercitrin improved the outcome of azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulphate-induced colorectal cancer along with anthocyanin though inhibiting inflammation and cell proliferation, but the effect of √é¬±-lipoic acid was minimal. Inhibition of cell proliferation by cilostazol was confirmed in√Ç vitro. In the acute dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis model, cilostazol and enzymatically modified isoquercitrin prevented the decrease in epithelial proliferative cells. These results indicate that cilostazol and enzymatically modified isoquercitrin first exhibited an anti-dextran sodium sulphate effect at the initial stage of colitis and then showed antitumour effects throughout subsequent inflammation-related cancer developmental stages.",include
26878064,Zinc Ionophore (Clioquinol) Inhibition of Human ZIP1-Deficient Prostate Tumor Growth in the Mouse Ectopic Xenograft Model: A Zinc Approach for the Efficacious Treatment of Prostate Cancer.,"Prostate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths in males. This is mainly due to the absence of an available efficacious chemotherapy despite decades of research in pursuit of effective treatment approaches. A plausible target for the treatment is the established clinical relationship that the zinc levels in the malignant cells are markedly decreased compared to the normal epithelium in virtually all cases of prostate cancer, and at all stages malignancy. The decrease in zinc results from the downregulation of the functional zinc uptake transporter, ZIP1; which occurs during early development of prostate malignancy. This is an essential requirement for the development of malignancy to prevent the cytotoxic/tumor-suppressor effects of increased zinc on the premalignant and malignant cells. Thus prostate cancer is a ZIP1-deficient malignancy. This relationship provides the basis for a treatment regimen that will facilitate the uptake and accumulation of zinc into the premalignant and malignant cells. In this report we employed a zinc ionophore (clioquinol) approach in the treatment of mice with human ZIP1-deficient prostate tumors (ectopic xenograft model). Clioquinol treatment resulted in 85%inhibition of tumor growth due to the cytotoxic effects of zinc. Coupled with additional results from earlier studies, the compelling evidence provides a plausible approach for the effective treatment of human prostate cancer; including primary site malignancy, hormone-resistant cancer, and metastasis. Additionally, this approach might be effective in preventing the development of malignancy in individuals suspected of presenting with early development of malignancy. Clinical trials are now required in leading to the potential for an efficacious zinc-treatment approach, which is urgently needed for the treatment of prostate cancer.",include
23999004,Antitumor activity of histamine and clozapine in a mouse experimental model of human melanoma.,"BACKGROUND: Functional presence of histamine H4 receptor (H4R) was demonstrated in human melanoma cell lines and biopsies. OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this work were to investigate signal transduction pathways and biological responses triggered by the activation of H4R in human primary (WM35) and metastatic (M1/15) melanoma cell lines and to evaluate the in vivo antitumor activity of histamine (HA) and clozapine (CLZ) on human M1/15 melanoma xenografts. METHODS: Clonogenic assay, incorporation of BrdU, cell cycle distribution, phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and cAMP production were evaluated in vitro. An experimental human melanoma model was developed into athymic nude mice. Tumor growth, survival and histochemical studies were performed in order to investigate the expression levels of H4R, HA, PCNA, mitotic index (MI), and angiogenesis. RESULTS: The results indicate that H4R agonists inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP levels only in M1/15 cells while increased phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and decreased proliferation in both cell types. In vivo studies show that HA and CLZ (1mgkg(-1), sc) significantly increased median survival and decreased tumor volume. These effects were associated to a reduction in MI, in the expression of proliferation marker and in intratumoral neovascularization. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that HA and CLZ exhibit an antitumoral effect in vitro and in vivo on human melanoma, suggesting the therapeutic potential of these compounds for the treatment of malignant melanoma.",include
20798593,Use of dabigatran etexilate to reduce breast cancer progression.,"Coagulation proteases and the generation of thrombin are increased in breast tumor epithelial and stromal cells. Since thrombin can modify tumor cell behavior directly through the activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs) or indirectly by generating fibrin matrices, the effect of dabigatran etexilate, a direct thrombin inhibitor, on breast cancer development was evaluated. Dabigatran inhibited invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells across Matrigel-coated membranes at concentrations that had no effect on the proliferation index of cultured tumor cells. In vivo evaluation of invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells in tracheal xenotransplants in nude mice orally administered dabigatran etexilate twice daily at a dose of 45 mg/kg over 4 weeks demonstrated less invasion of tumor cells through the tracheal wall compared to vehicle-treated mice. To evaluate the effect of dabigatran on the development of metastatic foci, 4T1 tumor cells were injected orthotopically in the mammary fat pads of syngeneic Balb/c mice. Dabigatran etexilate treatment exhibited evidence of antitumor activity with a 50% reduction in tumor volume at 4 weeks following orthotopic injection of 4T1 cells in syngeneic Balb/c mice with no weight loss in treated mice. Dabigatran etexilate reduced both 4T1 tumor cells in the blood and liver micrometastases by 50-60%. These results suggest that oral administration of the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran etexilate, inhibits both invasion and metastasis of malignant breast tumors, suggesting that it may be beneficial in not only preventing thrombotic events in cancer patients, but also as adjunct therapy to treat malignant tumors.",include
30685222,A study in a rat initiation-promotion bladder tumour model demonstrated no promoter/progressor potential of dapagliflozin.,"Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, is indicated to improve glycaemic control in adults of type 2 diabetes. In nonclinical studies, dapagliflozin was neither genotoxic nor carcinogenic. However, in some clinical studies, an increased incidence of bladder cancer was observed in the dapagliflozin group vs. the placebo. Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine if dapagliflozin can act as a promoter in a 2-stage bladder cancer model in rats induced with N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN). Rats given BBN (100 or 400√¢‚Ç¨¬Ømg/kg, po) twice weekly for 6 weeks in Phase 1 were assigned in Phase 2 to receive daily dose of vehicle, dapagliflozin (0.5√¢‚Ç¨¬Ømg/kg, po) or uracil (positive control, 3% in diet) from weeks 8-34. All bladders were evaluated by histopathology. Verifying the validity of the model, uracil increased the incidence of bladder cancer, while dapagliflozin had no effect on the incidence or invasiveness of transitional cell carcinoma. The exposure of dapagliflozin at 0.5√¢‚Ç¨¬Ømg/kg/day in rats was 7 times the clinical exposure at maximal therapeutic dose (10√¢‚Ç¨¬Ømg). In conclusion, dapagliflozin does not act as promoter or progressor of bladder cancer in a validated bladder cancer model in rats.",include
27833388,"Effects of an oral iron chelator, deferasirox, on advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.","AIM: To evaluate the inhibitory effects of deferasirox (DFX) against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through basic and clinical studies. METHODS: In the basic study, the effect of DFX was investigated in three hepatoma cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B, and Huh7), as well as in an N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced murine HCC model. In the clinical study, six advanced HCC patients refractory to chemotherapy were enrolled. The initial dose of DFX was 10 mg/kg per day and was increased by 10 mg/kg per day every week, until the maximum dose of 30 mg/kg per day. The duration of a single course of DFX therapy was 28 consecutive days. In the event of dose-limiting toxicity (according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.4.0), DFX dose was reduced. RESULTS: Administration of DFX inhibited the proliferation of hepatoma cell lines and induced the activation of caspase-3 in a dose-dependent manner <i>in vitro</i>. In the murine model, DFX treatment significantly suppressed the development of liver tumors (<i>P</i> < 0.01), and significantly upregulated the mRNA expression levels of hepcidin (<i>P</i> < 0.05), transferrin receptor 1 (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and hypoxia inducible factor-1√é¬± (<i>P</i> < 0.05) in both tumor and non-tumor tissues, compared with control mice. In the clinical study, anorexia and elevated serum creatinine were observed in four and all six patients, respectively. However, reduction in DFX dose led to decrease in serum creatinine levels in all patients. After the first course of DFX, one patient discontinued the therapy. We assessed the tumor response in the remaining five patients; one patient exhibited stable disease, while four patients exhibited progressive disease. The one-year survival rate of the six patients was 17%. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that DFX inhibited HCC in the basic study, but not in the clinical study due to dose-limiting toxicities.",include
29983871,"Deferasirox, an oral iron chelator, with gemcitabine synergistically inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.","Objectives: Iron is an essential element for cell proliferation and growth processes. We have reported that deferasirox (DFX), an oral iron chelator, showed antiproliferative activity against pancreatic cancer cells. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of combination of gemcitabine (GEM), standard chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer, and DFX <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Results: GEM+DFX showed antiproliferative activity and induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells <i>in vitro</i>. GEM+DFX suppressed xenograft tumor growth and induced apoptosis without any serious side effects compared with control, GEM, and DFX (average tumor volume: control 697 mm<sup>3</sup> vs GEM 372 mm<sup>3</sup>, <i>p</i> < 0.05; GEM 372 mm<sup>3</sup> vs GEM+DFX 234 mm<sup>3</sup>, <i>p</i> < 0.05). RRM1 and RRM2 protein levels were substantially reduced by DFX in BxPC-3 <i>in vitro</i>. Conclusion: GEM+DFX has significant anticancer effects on pancreatic cancer cell through RR activity suppression. Methods: BxPC-3, a human pancreatic cancer cell line, was used in all experiments. Cellular proliferation rate was measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry and by measuring caspase 3/7 activity with luminescence assay. In the tumor xenografts in nude mice models, when five weeks after engraftment, drug administration began (day 0). After treatment for 21 days, the mice were sacrificed and the tumors were excised. Apoptotic cells in xenografts were evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling assay. Protein levels of ribonucleotide reductase (RR) subunit 1 (RRM1) and RR subunit 2 (RRM2) in BxPC-3 cells were assessed by western blot <i>in vitro</i>.",include
23074173,"The iron chelator, deferasirox, as a novel strategy for cancer treatment: oral activity against human lung tumor xenografts and molecular mechanism of action.","Deferasirox is an orally effective iron (Fe) chelator currently used for the treatment of iron-overload disease and has been implemented as an alternative to the gold standard chelator, desferrioxamine (DFO). Earlier studies demonstrated that DFO exhibits anticancer activity due to its ability to deplete cancer cells of iron. In this investigation, we examined the in vitro and in vivo activity of deferasirox against cells from human solid tumors. To date, there have been no studies to investigate the effect of deferasirox on these types of tumors in vivo. Deferasirox demonstrated similar activity at inhibiting proliferation of DMS-53 lung carcinoma and SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cell lines compared with DFO. Furthermore, deferasirox was generally similar or slightly more effective than DFO at mobilizing cellular (59)Fe and inhibiting iron uptake from human transferrin depending on the cell type. However, deferasirox potently inhibited DMS-53 xenograft growth in nude mice when given by oral gavage, with no marked alterations in normal tissue histology. To understand the antitumor activity of deferasirox, we investigated its effect on the expression of molecules that play key roles in metastasis, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. We demonstrated that deferasirox increased expression of the metastasis suppressor protein N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 and upregulated the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(CIP1/WAF1) while decreasing cyclin D1 levels. Moreover, this agent increased the expression of apoptosis markers, including cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1. Collectively, we demonstrate that deferasirox is an orally effective antitumor agent against solid tumors.",include
24908354,The growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effect of deferoxamine combined with arsenic trioxide on HL-60 xenografts in nude mice.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate the growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effect of deferoxamine (DFO) combined with arsenic trioxide (ATO) on the human HL-60 xenografts in nude mice and its mechanism. METHOD: The highly tumorigenic leukemia cell line HL-60 cells were inoculated subcutaneously into nude mice to establish a human leukemia xenograft model. The HL-60 xenograft nude mice models were randomly divided into four groups: control (Normal saline, NS), 50mg/kg DFO, 3mg/kg ATO, the combined treatment (50mg/kg DFO+1.5mg/kg ATO) once HL-60 cells were inoculated. Tumor sizes, growth curves, inhibitory rates, cell apoptosis, and the expression of apoptosis related markers were measured to evaluate the tumor growth. RESULTS: Xenografted tumors were observed in all nude mice since the 5th day of inoculation. The inhibitory rates of tumor weight were 2.67%, 10.69%, and 25.57% in DFO, ATO and combination therapy groups, respectively. The combination of DFO with ATO induces significantly more tumor cell apoptosis than either agent alone (p<0.05). The expression of NF-√é¬∫Bp65 and survivin proteins decreased significantly while the expression of Caspase-3 and Bax increased in the combination therapy group (p<0.05). Double immunofluorescence for Caspase-3 and NF√é¬∫Bp65 demonstrated an inverse relationship between Caspase-3-positive areas and NF√é¬∫Bp65-positive areas, as well as the co-localization of Bax and survivin in xenografted tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Combination of DFO and ATO has synergistic effects on tumor growth inhibition and apoptosis-inducing in vivo with no significant side effects. The DFO and ATO can up-regulate the expression of Caspase-3 and Bax, and down-regulate the expression of NF-√é¬∫Bp65 and survivin, especially for their combination.",include
29269744,Econazole nitrate inhibits PI3K activity and promotes apoptosis in lung cancer cells.,"The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in many cellular processes, including the proliferation, survival and differentiation of lung cancer cells. Thus, PI3K is a promising therapeutic target for lung cancer treatment. In this study, we applied free and open-source protein-ligand docking software, screened 3167 FDA-approved small molecules, and identified putative PI3K√é¬± inhibitors. Among them, econazole nitrate, an antifungal agent, exhibited the highest activity in decreasing cell viability in pathological types of NSCLC cell lines, including H661 (large cell lung cancer) and A549 (adenocarcinoma). Econazole decreased the protein levels of p-AKT and Bcl-2, but had no effect on the phosphorylation level of ERK. It inhibited cell growth and promote apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the combination of econazole and cisplatin exhibited additive and synergistic effects in the H661 and A549 lung cancer cell lines, respectively. Finally, we demonstrated that econazole significantly suppressed A549 tumor growth in nude mice. Our findings suggest that econazole is a new PI3K inhibitor and a potential drug that can be used in lung cancer treatment alone or in combination with cisplatin.",include
15517894,High efficacy of docetaxel with and without androgen deprivation and estramustine in preclinical models of advanced prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: To assess the activity of docetaxel in combination with hormonal therapy in preclinical models of prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Since prostate cancer has a predilection for the bone, we assessed the antitumor activity of docetaxel in in vivo models of both bone metastasis and localized prostate cancer, using MDA PCa 2b and PC3 cells in SCID mice. RESULTS: Dramatic antitumor efficacy was observed regardless of whether the tumor cells were implanted in the prostate or in the bone. Antitumor activity was also evident in both osteolytic and osteoblastic lesions. Reasoning that docetaxel efficacy might be enhanced if it were to be used earlier in the course of the disease, we studied the sequence of docetaxel and androgen ablation (part of standard treatment for early-stage prostate cancer) in the MDA PCa 2b xenograft model. The activity was similar whether docetaxel and androgen ablation were used alone, simultaneously, or in sequence, indicating a lack of synergism or antagonism. Finally, we studied the combination of docetaxel and estramustine on androgen-sensitive and androgen-independent cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Estramustine did not increase the activity of docetaxel in these models. CONCLUSION: These results provide a strong preclinical rationale for the clinical development of docetaxel for the treatment of both locally advanced and disseminated prostate cancer.",include
20109999,Effectiveness and tolerability of colesevelam hydrochloride for bile-acid malabsorption in patients with cancer: a retrospective chart review and patient questionnaire.,"BACKGROUND: Commercially available bile-acid sequestrants are not well tolerated by >80% of patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of colesevelam hydrochloride in patients who developed bile-acid malabsorption after cancer therapy. METHODS: The present study comprised 2 parts: a retrospective chart review of the electronic patient records and a patient questionnaire assessing outcome measures. All patients included in this study had a diagnosis of cancer and were being followed up in a cancer clinic at The Royal Marsden Hospital. In addition, all had symptoms of bile-acid malabsorption for >3 months and had been prescribed colesevelam in the gastroenterology clinic at the hospital. The electronic records of patients who were prescribed colesevelam between 2004 and 2007 were obtained from the hospital pharmacy. Those patients who were prescribed colesevelam and did not take any of the prescribed medication or did not return for a follow-up clinical review were excluded. To help further assess outcomes, a questionnaire was mailed to patients who were still residing in the United Kingdom, were not terminally ill, and were not lost to follow-up. The questionnaire comprised questions that assessed medication history (ie, whether patients were still taking colesevelam or not [and the reason for not taking colesevelam]), dosage, effectiveness for symptom relief, and adverse events. RESULTS: In total, 45 patients (37 women and 8 men; median age, 58 years [range, 32-89 years]) who received treatment with colesevelam between 2004 and 2007 were included. Of these, 36 were sent a questionnaire and 30 responded. Identifiable causes of bile acid malabsorption in this sample population were pelvic radiotherapy (n = 29), small-bowel resection (12), upper gastrointestinal surgery (2), high-dose chemotherapy (1), and new-onset Crohn's disease (1). Of these patients, 67% (30/45) had not previously responded to cholestyramine treatment, but following treatment with colesevelam, this group had a recorded improvement in: diarrhea, 83% (25/30); urgency of defecation, 74% (20/27); frequency of defecation, 72% (21/29); steatorrhea, 71% (12/17); abdominal pain, 68% (15/22); and fecal incontinence, 62% (13/21). Based on the medical chart review and the patient questionnaire, after colesevelam treatment, the following proportions of all 45 patients studied experienced improvement in symptoms: loose stool (diarrhea), 88% (medical chart) and 80% (questionnaire); frequency of defecation, 77% and 83%, respectively; steatorrhea, 76% and 80%; urgency of defecation, 76% and 80%; abdominal pain, 74% and 58%; and fecal incontinence, 69% and 74%. During the study period, 15 patients discontinued colesevelam: ineffectiveness, 5; adverse events, 5 (because >or=1 of the following: bloating, constipation, heartburn, abdominal pain, flatulence, or perianal soreness); and other reasons, 7 (too many tablets or tablets difficult to swallow [3]; symptoms resolved [2]; colesevelam replaced with another medication [1]; and lost to follow-up [1]). Sixty-seven percent (30/45) of patients continued using colesevelam for up to 4 years. CONCLUSION: In view of the data found in this retrospective chart review and patient questionnaire, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of colesevelam for bile acid malabsorption are warranted.",exclude
27344439,A post hoc analysis of dalteparin versus oral anticoagulant (VKA) therapy for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (rVTE) in patients with cancer and renal impairment.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common and serious complication in patients with cancer; treatment guidelines recommend extended therapy of √¢‚Ä∞¬•6√Ç months with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) for treatment and prevention of recurrent VTE (rVTE) in this population. This post hoc analysis used data from the CLOT study-a phase III, randomized, open-label, controlled study (N√Ç =√Ç 676)-to compare the efficacy and safety of dalteparin, a LMWH, versus vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for prevention of rVTE in patients with cancer and renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60√Ç ml/min). Overall, 162/676 (24√Ç %) patients had renal impairment at baseline. Patients received subcutaneous dalteparin 200√Ç IU/kg once daily during month 1, followed by 150√Ç IU/kg once daily for months 2-6; or VKA once daily for 6√Ç months, with initial overlapping subcutaneous dalteparin 200√Ç IU/kg once daily for √¢‚Ä∞¬•5√Ç days until international normalized ratio was 2.0-3.0 for 2 consecutive days. Endpoints included the rates of rVTE (primary) and bleeding events. Overall, fewer dalteparin-treated patients (2/74 [2.7√Ç %]) experienced √¢‚Ä∞¬•1 adjudicated symptomatic rVTE compared with VKA-treated patients (15/88 [17.0√Ç %]; hazard ratio√Ç =√Ç 0.15 [95√Ç % confidence interval 0.03-0.65]; p√Ç =√Ç 0.01). Bleeding event rates for both treatments were similar (p√Ç =√Ç 0.47). In summary, compared with VKA, dalteparin significantly reduced risk of rVTE in patients with cancer and renal impairment (p√Ç =√Ç 0.01) while exhibiting a comparable safety profile. This analysis supports dosing patients with renal impairment in accordance with patients with normal renal function; however, anti-Xa monitoring could be considered to further support safety in selected patients, particularly those with very severe renal impairment.",exclude

We retrospectively analysed the efficacy of short-course ALT with DPT in combination with systemic treatment (ST) for CoNS-associated CRBSI in our hospital. METHODS: Patients admitted for CoNS-associated CRBSI and treated with DPT as ALT and ST were retrospectively analysed. Success was defined as preservation of the catheter device 30 days after ending treatment. Catheter removal within 30 days of discontinuing treatment, for either microbiological documentation of CRBSI relapse or re-occurrence of unexplained fever, was considered as failure. RESULTS: Among 7610 patients admitted to the Departments of Internal Medicine/Infectious Diseases and Pneumology in Cannes from January 2013 to November 2015, we identified 28 episodes of CoNS-associated CRBSI. Seven patients died of cancer during follow-up. Thus, 21 episodes were analysed among 20 patients (median age 67 years, 12 males, all treated for neoplasia and carrying a port-a-cath√Ç¬Æ device). Staphylococcus epidermidis was the main agent responsible for CRBSI. Median duration of systemic and ALT DPT was 3 days, in combination with rifampin for 4 days and then generally followed by a switch to oral drugs, most frequently cotrimoxazole or linezolid, to achieve 14 median days of treatment. Clinical success and failure rates were 76% and 24%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Short-course DPT as ALT, combined with 14 days of ST, allowed conservative management of CoNS-associated CRBSI in surgically implanted-catheters in three-fourth of cases.",exclude

Eligible patients were randomized to slow-release morphine plus DM or slow-release morphine plus placebo. The initial DM dose was 60 mg four times daily for seven days, with an increase to 120 mg four times daily, if tolerated, for another seven days. During the study, patients recorded medications and scores for pain, nausea, drowsiness, and insomnia. Sixty-five patients were randomized. Although average pain scores (12.6 vs. 15.8), number of breakthrough doses (9 vs. 11.3), and change in total morphine consumption (550.9 mg vs. 597.1mg) were less in the DM group than placebo group, the differences were not statistically significant (P=0.31-0.33). Side-effect scores were not statistically significantly different. Dizziness was greater in the DM (58%) than placebo (36%) group. This study showed a statistically nonsignificant enhancement of analgesia or modulation of opioid tolerance in cancer patients with pain when DM was added to morphine. Participants receiving the DM also had more toxicity, particularly dizziness. This toxicity and the limited evidence of effect do not support the use of DM to enhance opioid analgesia or to modulate opioid tolerance in cancer patients.",exclude

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer patients (n = 609) receiving first-course cisplatin chemotherapy were randomized to one of three treatments: 1.8 or 2.4 mg/kg dolasetron mesylate salt (equivalent to 1.3 and 1.8 mg/kg dolasetron base, respectively) or 32 mg ondansetron. Each treatment was infused over 15 minutes, 30 minutes before cisplatin administration. Patients were stratified to cisplatin doses of > or = 70 and less than 91 mg/m2 (n = 368) or > or = 91 mg/m2 (n = 241), administered over < or = 3 hours. Protocol-defined efficacy criteria included complete response (zero emetic episodes and no rescue medication), major response (1 to 2 emetic episodes and no rescue medication), and patients' report of nausea severity and satisfaction recorded on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: The three treatments met protocol-specified criteria for equivalence. Complete response rates for dolasetron mesylate 1.8 mg/kg, 2.4 mg/kg, and ondansetron, respectively, were 49.2%, 45.6%, and 50.4% for patients in the lower cisplatin stratum (mean, 74.7 mg/m2) and 36.8%, 31.3%, and 31.8% in the higher cisplatin stratum (mean, 100.6 mg/m2). No significant differences were observed in the extent of nausea with either dolasetron dose compared with ondansetron. Less nausea was noted with 1.8 mg/kg dolasetron compared with the 2.4 mg/kg dose (P = .044) All three antiemetic treatments were well tolerated. Asymptomatic electrocardiogram changes were recorded with both dolasetron and ondansetron. CONCLUSION: A single IV dose of dolasetron mesylate (1.8 or 2.4 mg/kg) has comparable safety and efficacy to a single 32-mg IV dose of ondansetron in patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy.",exclude

Chemical permeation enhancers were evaluated and selected according to the results obtained from rheological studies, drug release, and drug permeation and retention through buccal mucosa. Finally, the selected formulation was compared in vivo, with a reference DOX mouthwash, whose clinical efficacy had been previously reported. The obtained findings showed that an orabase√Ç¬Æ platform loading transcutol√Ç¬Æ (10%) and menthol (5%) for the buccal vehiculization of DOX exhibited a decreased elastic and viscous behavior improving its application. The main drug release mechanism could be considered as diffusion according to Higuchi model. Obtained DOX permeation rates were considered optimal for an analgesic effect and far below to an antidepressant activity. Similar in vivo plasma concentrations were found for the semisolid formulation and the reference mouthwash. However, DOX amounts retained in the mucosa of animals for the semisolid formulation were higher than the reference, which let us hypostatize even stronger potential local therapeutic effect with additional advantages such as, mucoadhesive properties, absence of alcohol, some degree of freshness, as well as, drug palatability improvement.",exclude
19108790,"Comparison of propofol, droperidol, and metoclopramide for prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting after breast cancer surgery: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in Japanese patients.","BACKGROUND: Breast cancer surgery performed with the patient under general anesthesia has been associated with a relatively high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Between 60% and 80% of patients who undergo mastectomy (with axillary dissection) experience PONV. We previously reported that propofol at a subhypnotic dose of 0.5 mg/kg was more effective than placebo in preventing PONV in women who undergo mastectomy. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of a subhypnotic dose of propofol with the conventional antiemetics droperidol and metoclopramide for the prophylaxis of PONV after breast cancer surgery in Japanese patients. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, Japanese women were randomized to 1 of 4 groups to receive IV administration of propofol 0.5 mg/kg, droperidol 20 microg/kg, metoclopramide 0.2 mg/kg, or placebo (isotonic saline) immediately after skin suture. A standard general anesthetic technique, including sevoflurane and air in oxygen, was used. All episodes of PONV during the first 24 hours after anesthesia administration were recorded by an investigator who was blinded to treatment assignment. The investigator questioned the patients as to whether they experienced extrapyramidal symptoms. To maintain the integrity of the study results, none of the patients received preanesthetic medication. RESULTS: A total of 100 women (mean [SD] age, 52 [7] years; height, 154 [6] cm; weight, 54 [7] kg) were included in the study. Each study group comprised 25 patients. There were no significant differences between treatment groups with regard to patient demographics, surgery type, or awakening time. The prevalences of PONV 0 to 24 hours after anesthesia were 28% with propofol (P = 0.005), 32% with droperidol (P = 0.011), and 60% with metoclopramide (P = NS), compared with placebo (68%). No significant difference in the prevalence of PONV was found between patients receiving propofol and those receiving droperidol, and propofol and droperidol were associated with significantly lower prevalences of PONV compared with metoclopramide (P = 0.022 and P = 0.043, respectively). Extrapyramidal symptoms were not reported in any of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalences of PONV were not significantly different between propofol 0.5 mg/kg and droperidol 20 microg/kg 0 to 24 hours after anesthesia in this small, select group of Japanese women who underwent breast cancer surgery. The prevalences of PONV were significantly lower with propofol and droperidol compared with metoclopramide 0.2 mg/kg and placebo.",exclude
28184263,A low dose of droperidol decreases the desflurane concentration needed during breast cancer surgery: a randomized double-blinded study.,"BACKGROUND: Droperidol (DHB) reportedly reduces the dose of propofol needed to achieve hypnosis when anesthesia is induced and decreases the bispectral index (BIS) in propofol-sedated patients during spinal anesthesia. We reported previously that supplemental DHB decreased the BIS after the administration of sevoflurane and remifentanil. This study investigated the effect of DHB on desflurane (DES) consumption in a clinical setting. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized double-blinded study of 35 women with American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status I or II who underwent a mastectomy. Either DHB (20 √Ç¬µg/kg) or a saline placebo was administered to patients 30 min after the induction of anesthesia. A blinded anesthesiologist maintained a BIS value of 50 during anesthesia by modulating inhaled DES concentrations that changed 0.5% at 2.5 min intervals and maintained analgesia via the constant administration of remifentanil by referring to vital signs. The primary endpoint was the effect of DHB on DES consumption. The secondary endpoints included blood circulatory parameters, the time from the end of surgery to extubation, and discharge time between the groups. RESULTS: The characteristics of the patients did not differ between the groups. The DHB group used a mean of 27.2 √Ç¬± 6.0 ml of DES compared with 41.4 √Ç¬± 9.5 ml by the placebo group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A small dose of DHB reduced the DES concentration needed to maintain a BIS of 50. Our results show that DHB reduced the consumption of DES without adverse effects.",exclude
27476789,"Edoxaban for venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer: results from a non-inferiority subgroup analysis of the Hokusai-VTE randomised, double-blind, double-dummy trial.","BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism occurs commonly in patients with cancer. Direct oral anticoagulants are non-inferior to conventional anticoagulants for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. We hypothesised that edoxaban, a direct oral inhibitor of activated clotting factor Xa, might be more suitable than conventional anticoagulants in the management of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of edoxaban compared with warfarin in a subgroup of patients with cancer enrolled in the Hokusai-VTE trial. METHODS: We did a prespecified subgroup analysis in August, 2013, and a post-hoc analysis of non-inferiority and safety in March, 2016, of the patients with cancer enrolled in the randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre, Hokusai-VTE trial done between Jan 28, 2010, and Oct 31, 2012. In this study, patients aged at least 18 years with acute symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis or acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism (with or without deep-vein thrombosis) were assigned to receive edoxaban 60 mg once per day (or 30 mg once per day for patients with a creatinine clearance of 30-50 mL/min, bodyweight <60 kg, or who were receiving concomitant treatment with the P-glycoprotein inhibitors quinidine or verapamil) or warfarin (dose adjusted to maintain the international normalised ratio between 2√Ç¬∑0 and 3√Ç¬∑0) or placebos for either group for at least 3 months up to 12 months. All patients received initial therapy with open-label enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin for at least 5 days. Edoxoban (or placebo) was started after discontinuation of initial heparin; warfarin (or placebo) started concurrently with the study regimen of heparin. In our analysis we examined data for a subgroup of these patients who had a history of cancer or who had been categorised as having active cancer by the study physician at the time of enrolment. Additionally, all patients with a history of cancer were reviewed post hoc and categorised according to the presence or absence of active cancer. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of these patients with symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism during the 12-month study period, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population, with an upper limit of the CI for the hazard ratio (HR) of 1√Ç¬∑5. The principal safety outcome was the proportion of patients who had clinically relevant bleeding in the population of patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00986154. FINDINGS: Of 771 patients with cancer enrolled in the trial, 378 were assigned to edoxaban and 393 to warfarin. Recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 14 (4%) of 378 patients given edoxaban and in 28 (7%) of 393 patients given warfarin (hazard ratio [HR] 0√Ç¬∑53, 95% CI 0√Ç¬∑28-1√Ç¬∑00; p=0√Ç¬∑0007). The upper limit of this 95% CI did not exceed the non-inferiority margin of 1√Ç¬∑5 that was prespecified for the trial. Clinically relevant bleeding (major or non-major) occurred in 47 (12%) of 378 patients who received edoxaban and in 74 (19%) of 393 patients who received warfarin; HR for clinically relevant bleeding 0√Ç¬∑64, 95% CI 0√Ç¬∑45-0√Ç¬∑92; p=0√Ç¬∑017. Major bleeding occurred in ten (3%) of 378 patients with a history of cancer who received edoxaban and in 13 (3%) of 393 who received warfarin (HR 0√Ç¬∑80, 95% CI 0√Ç¬∑35-1√Ç¬∑83). INTERPRETATION: Edoxaban might be as effective as warfarin for the treatment of patients with cancer with venous thromboembolism, and with less clinically relevant bleeding. Additional clinical trials of edoxaban versus low-molecular-weight heparin for the treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer are warranted. FUNDING: Daiichi Sankyo.",exclude
25550798,Effect of celecoxib combined with chemotherapy drug on malignant biological behaviors of gastric cancer.,"Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, has been reported to have antitumor effects. In some tumor models, the combination of celecoxib with chemotherapy agents has shown synergistic antitumor effect; however, the effect of celecoxib combination with tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium on the malignant biological behaviors of gastric cancer in nude mice is unclear. In this study, female nude mice were subcutaneously transplanted with SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells. When the tumor model formed, the mice were divided into control group, celecoxib group, tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium group, and the combination of both drug regimens group. Mice were treated for 3 weeks. Following treatment, the proliferating index was calculated, apoptosis related proteins, COX-2, vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and lymphatic vessel density were quantified in tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry. Apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL staining. The results revealed that celecoxib and tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium alone significantly inhibited tumor growth. The combination of these two drugs showed a synergistic antitumor effect. Both celecoxib and tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium alone inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis. The combination of these two drugs further enhanced this anticancer effect. Both celecoxib and the combination treatment inhibited lymphangiogenesis and the expression of COX-2 and VEGF-C. However, tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium treatment had no obvious effect on lymphangiogenesis. These results suggested that the combination of celecoxib and tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium produced a synergistic antitumor effect, possibly by inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells and promoting apoptosis. Celecoxib and celecoxib in combination with tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium possibly by reducing the expression of COX-2, in turn down-regulating the expression of VEGF-C, resulted in the inhibition of lymphangiogenesis.",include
20621900,Extended-duration venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients with recently reduced mobility: a randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND: Extended-duration low-molecular-weight heparin has been shown to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in high-risk surgical patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of extended-duration enoxaparin thromboprophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients. DESIGN: Randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled trial. Randomization was computer-generated. Allocation was centralized. Patients, caregivers, and outcome assessors were blinded to group assignment. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00077753) SETTING: 370 sites in 20 countries across North and South America, Europe, and Asia. PATIENTS: Acutely ill medical patients 40 years or older with recently reduced mobility (bed rest or sedentary without [level 1] or with [level 2] bathroom privileges). Eligibility criteria for patients with level 2 immobility were amended to include only those who had additional VTE risk factors (age >75 years, history of VTE, or active or previous cancer) after interim analyses suggested lower-than-expected VTE rates. INTERVENTION: Enoxaparin, 40 mg/d subcutaneously (2975 patients), or placebo (2988 patients), for 28 +/- 4 days after receiving open-label enoxaparin for an initial 10 +/- 4 days. MEASUREMENTS: Incidence of VTE up to day 28 and of major bleeding events up to 48 hours after the last study treatment dose. RESULTS: Extended-duration enoxaparin reduced VTE incidence compared with placebo (2.5% vs. 4%; absolute risk difference favoring enoxaparin, -1.53% [95.8% CI, -2.54% to -0.52%]). Enoxaparin increased major bleeding events (0.8% vs. 0.3%; absolute risk difference favoring placebo, 0.51% [95% CI, 0.12% to 0.89%]). The benefits of extended-duration enoxaparin seemed to be restricted to women, patients older than 75 years, and those with level 1 immobility. LIMITATION: Estimates of efficacy and safety for the overall trial population are difficult to interpret because of the change in eligibility criteria during the trial. CONCLUSION: Use of extended-duration enoxaparin reduces VTE more than it increases major bleeding events in acutely ill medical patients with level 1 immobility, those older than 75 years, and women.

26728433,Aspirin and atenolol enhance metformin activity against breast cancer by targeting both neoplastic and microenvironment cells.,"Metformin can induce breast cancer (BC) cell apoptosis and reduce BC local and metastatic growth in preclinical models. Since Metformin is frequently used along with Aspirin or beta-blockers, we investigated the effect of Metformin, Aspirin and the beta-blocker Atenolol in several BC models. In vitro, Aspirin synergized with Metformin in inducing apoptosis of triple negative and endocrine-sensitive BC cells, and in activating AMPK in BC and in white adipose tissue (WAT) progenitors known to cooperate to BC progression. Both Aspirin and Atenolol added to the inhibitory effect of Metformin against complex I of the respiratory chain. In both immune-deficient and immune-competent preclinical models, Atenolol increased Metformin activity against angiogenesis, local and metastatic growth of HER2+ and triple negative BC. Aspirin increased the activity of Metformin only in immune-competent HER2+ BC models. Both Aspirin and Atenolol, when added to Metformin, significantly reduced the endothelial cell component of tumor vessels, whereas pericytes were reduced by the addition of Atenolol but not by the addition of Aspirin. Our data indicate that the addition of Aspirin or of Atenolol to Metformin might be beneficial for BC control, and that this activity is likely due to effects on both BC and microenvironment cells.",include
30414098,Mebendazole and radiation in combination increase survival through anticancer mechanisms in an intracranial rodent model of malignant meningioma.,"PURPOSE: Meningiomas are a frequent tumor of the central nervous system. Although mostly benign, approximately 5% present as atypical or malignant tumors. Treatments for atypical meningiomas include gross total resection and radiotherapy, but about 33% of patients have recurrent tumors, sometimes as a higher grade. Recently, the brain penetrant anthelmintic drug, mebendazole, has shown promise as an anticancer agent in rodent models of glioblastoma and medulloblastoma. METHODS: The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) effect on colony formation, cell proliferation, and caspase-3/7 markers of apoptosis of mebendazole with and without radiation was measured in vitro. Mice intracranially implanted with KT21MG1 human meningioma were administered mebendazole alone or in combination with radiation. Survival benefit was evaluated, while tumors were investigated by immunohistochemical staining for apoptosis, cell proliferation, and vascular density. RESULTS: In vitro experiments on meningioma cell lines showed the IC<sub>50</sub> for mebendazole in the range of 0.26-0.42√Ç √Ç¬µM. Mebendazole alone induced cytotoxicity, however the combination had a greater reduction in colony formation and resulted in higher levels of cleaved caspase-3. The in vivo study showed both, mebendazole alone and the combination, to have a survival benefit with an increase in apoptosis, and decreases in tumor cell and vascular proliferation. CONCLUSION: These preclinical findings indicate that mebendazole alone or in combination with radiation can be considered for the treatment of malignant meningioma. The mechanism of action for this combination may include an increase in apoptosis, a reduction in proliferation and angiogenesis, or a combination of these effects.",include
27470571,Candesartan attenuates angiogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma via downregulating AT1R/VEGF pathway.,"Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) was reported to express in many types of tumors, promoting tumor growth and angiogenesis. We herein examined AT1R expression in liver cancer and the potential antitumor effects of AT1R antagonist Candesartan in liver cancer. We found that AT1R expression was positively correlated with VEGF-A expression and microvascular density (MVD) in 40 HCC patients. Angiotensin II and Candesartan neither had effects on the proliferation of liver cancer cells in vitro. However, Angiotensin II upregulated AT1R protein expression and promoted production of VEGF-A in liver cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Candesartan was able to reverse this process in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Candesartan downregulated the expression of VEGF-A in SMMC-7721 bearing xenografts in mice and inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo. Our data suggested that AT1R antagonist Candesartan might be useful to suppress liver cancer by inhibiting angiogenesis.",include
29188798,Capsaicin enhances the antitumor activity of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma cells and mouse xenograft tumors through increased ERK signaling.,"Sorafenib, a small inhibitor of tyrosine protein kinases, is currently the standard chemotherapy drug for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although sorafenib improves the survival of HCC patients, its efficacy is not optimal and requires further improvement. Capsaicin, the major active component of chili peppers from the genus Capsicum, is not only the agonist of TRPV1 channel, but also displays antitumor activity and enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs. In this study, we investigated the antitumor effects of combined sorafenib and capsaicin on HCC cells in vitro and xenograft tumors. Treatment with capsaicin alone dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of the HCC cell lines PLC/PRF/7, HuH7 and HepG2 with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 137, 108 and 140.7 √é¬ºmol/L, respectively. No obvious expression of TRPV1 channel was detected in the 3 HCC cell lines and TRPV1 channel blockers did not alleviate the cytotoxicity of capsaicin. By contrast, combining capsaicin and sorafenib significantly enhanced the suppression on cell proliferation, achieving a high-level synergistic effect (inhibition rates over 50%) and promoting HCC cell apoptosis. In nude mice with PLC/PRF/5 xenografts, combined administration of capsaicin and sorafenib significantly enhanced the suppression on tumor growth without apparent gross toxicity compared to either agent alone. Mechanistically, capsaicin (10-200 √é¬ºmol/L) dose-dependently increased the levels of phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) in PLC/PRF/5 cells, thus leading to enhanced sorafenib sensitivity and a synergistic suppression on the tumor cells. Taken together, our results suggest that capsaicin-increased phosphorylation of ERK contributes to the enhanced antitumor activity of sorafenib, and capsaicin may be useful in improving the efficacy of sorafenib for the treatment of HCC.",include
22271897,The human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease inhibitor nelfinavir impairs proteasome activity and inhibits the proliferation of multiple myeloma cells in vitro and in vivo.,"BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma is characterized by the accumulation of tumor plasma cells in the bone marrow. Despite therapeutic improvements brought by proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, myeloma remains an incurable disease. In a variety of human cancers, human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors (e.g. nelfinavir) effectively inhibit tumor progression, but their impact on myeloma is unknown. We assessed the in vitro and in vivo effects of nelfinavir on multiple myeloma. DESIGN AND METHODS: The effects of nelfinavir (1-10 √é¬ºM) on proteasome activity, proliferation and viability of myeloma cell lines and plasma cells from patients were assessed by measuring PERK, AKT, STAT3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and CHOP expression with immunoblotting or flow cytometry. The in vivo effect was assessed in NOD/SCID mice injected with luciferase expressing human myeloma cell lines and treated with nelfinavir at a dose of 75 mg/kg/day. Tumor progression was evaluated using a bioluminescent system. RESULTS: Nelfinavir inhibited 26S chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity, impaired proliferation and triggered apoptosis of the myeloma cell lines and fresh plasma cells. It activated the pro-apoptotic unfolded protein response pathway by inducing PERK phosphorylation and CHOP expression. Cell death triggered by nelfinavir treatment correlated with decreased phosphorylation of AKT, STAT3 and ERK1/2. Nelfinavir enhanced the anti-proliferative activity of bortezomib, dexamethasone and histone deacetylase inhibitors and delayed tumor growth in a myeloma mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that nelfinavir, used at a pharmacological dosage, alone or in combination, may be useful in the treatment of myeloma. Our data provide a preclinical basis for clinical trials using nelfinavir in patients with myeloma.",include

We recently discovered the novel small-molecule DJ101 as a potent and metabolically stable tubulin inhibitor that can circumvent the drug efflux pumps responsible for multidrug resistance of existing tubulin inhibitors. In this study, we determined the mechanism of action of this drug. The basis for its activity was illuminated by solving the crystal structure of DJ101 in complex with tubulin at a resolution of 2.8√É‚Ä¶. Investigations of the potency of DJ101 in a panel of human metastatic melanoma cell lines harboring major clinically relevant mutations defined IC<sub>50</sub> values of 7-10 nmol/L. In cells, DJ101 disrupted microtubule networks, suppressed anchorage-dependent melanoma colony formation, and impaired cancer cell migration. In melanoma-bearing mice, DJ101 administration inhibited tumor growth and reduced lung metastasis in the absence of observable toxicity. DJ101 also completely inhibited tumor growth in a paclitaxel-resistant xenograft mouse model of human prostate cancer (PC-3/TxR), where paclitaxel was minimally effective. Our findings offer preclinical proof of concept for the continued development of DJ101 as a next-generation tubulin inhibitor for cancer therapy.<b>Significance:</b> These findings offer preclinical proof of concept for the continued development of DJ101 as a next-generation antitubulin drug for cancer therapy. <i>Cancer Res; 78(1); 265-77. √Ç¬©2017 AACR</i>.",exclude

It has recently been demonstrated to inhibit tumor progression and metastasis in breast cancer models. Docetaxel is a chemotherapy agent for castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In this study, the ability of CRPC cells to grow and develop in vivo tumors in an animal model was evaluated, in order to investigate the anti-tumor effect of desmopressin in combination with docetaxel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CRPC cell line PC3 was used for orthotopic inoculation in male athymic nude mice. The mice were randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups: Control, docetaxel, desmopressin or combination therapy. Following the last treatment, tumors were excised and measured. Blood samples were processed for CTC analysis. RESULTS: Docetaxel treatment resulted in a significant reduction in tumor volume compared to control. The combination therapy resulted in even more significant reduction (31.2%) in tumor volume. There was a complete absence of CTCs in the combination group.

It acts as a selective agonist for the V2 vasopressin membrane receptor (V2r) present on tumour cells and microvasculature. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the novel peptide derivative [V4Q5]dDAVP in V2r-expressing preclinical mouse models of breast cancer. We assessed antitumour effects of [V4Q5]dDAVP using human MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells, as well as the highly metastatic mouse F3II cell line. Effect on in vitro cancer cell growth was evaluated by cell proliferation and clonogenic assays. Cell cycle distribution was analysed by flow cytometry. In order to study the effect of intravenously administered [V4Q5]dDAVP on tumour growth and angiogenesis, breast cancer xenografts were generated in athymic mice. F3II cells were injected into syngeneic mice to evaluate the effect of [V4Q5]dDAVP on spontaneous and experimental metastatic spread. In vitro cytostatic effects of [V4Q5]dDAVP against breast cancer cells were greater than those of dDAVP, and associated with V2r-activated signal transduction and partial cell cycle arrest. In MDA-MB-231 xenografts, [V4Q5]dDAVP (0.3 √Ç¬µg/kg, thrice a week) reduced tumour growth and angiogenesis. Treatment of F3II mammary tumour-bearing immunocompetent mice resulted in complete inhibition of metastatic progression. [V4Q5]dDAVP also displayed greater antimetastatic efficacy than dDAVP on experimental lung colonisation by F3II cells. The novel analogue was well tolerated in preliminary acute toxicology studies, at doses √¢‚Ä∞¬• 300-fold above that required for anti-angiogenic/antimetastatic effects.

27779705,Diphenhydramine induces melanoma cell apoptosis by suppressing STAT3/MCL-1 survival signaling and retards B16-F10 melanoma growth in vivo.,"Melanoma is the most aggressive skin malignancy with a high rate of mortality and is frequently refractory to many therapeutics, thus demanding the discovery of novel effective anti-melanoma agents. Diphenhydramine√Ç (DPH) is an H1 histamine receptor antagonist and a relatively safe drug. Previous studies have revealed the in√Ç vitro cytotoxicity of DPH against melanoma cells, but the mechanisms involved concerning its cytotoxicity and the in√Ç vivo anti-melanoma effect remain unknown. We herein present the first evidence supporting that DPH is selectively proapoptotic for a panel of melanoma cell lines irrespective of BRAFV600E status while sparing normal melanocytes. Of note, DPH effectively suppressed tumor growth and prolonged the length of survival of mice bearing B16-F10 melanoma. Mechanistic investigation further revealed that DPH downregulated antiapoptotic MCL-1, whereas MCL-1 overexpression impeded the proapoptotic action of DPH. Moreover, DPH attenuated STAT3 activation, as evidenced by the reduced levels of tyrosine 705-phosphorylated STAT3. Notably, ectopic expression of constitutively active STAT3 mutant reduced DPH-induced apoptosis but also protected MCL-1 from downregulation by DPH, illustrating that DPH impairs STAT3 activation to block STAT3-mediated induction of MCL-1 in eliciting apoptosis. Collectively, we for the first time validate the in√Ç vivo anti√¢‚Ç¨‚Äòmelanoma effect of DPH and also establish DPH as a drug targeting STAT3/MCL-1 survival signaling pathway to induce apoptosis. Our discovery therefore suggests the potential to repurpose DPH as an anti-melanoma therapeutic agent.",include

This study is aimed to further investigate whether KMUP-1 and doxazosin prevent from prostate cancer cell growth via androgen-dependent and -independent pathway in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: KMUP-1 was measured the activity on proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle distribution in prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, DU-145, PC-3) by MTT assay, flow cytometry, Western Blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The inhibition activities on androgen receptor (AR) and AR-targeting molecular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression by KMUP-1 and doxazosin were measured by RT-PCR, Western Blotting, and ELISA. Furthermore, we confirmed the effects of KMUP-1 on growth of LNCaP xenografts in nude mice. RESULTS: KMUP-1 significantly inhibited LNCaP cell growth and induced apoptosis in time- and dose-dependent manner. KMUP-1 and doxazosin further inhibited the expression of AR and PSA. Treatment of LNCaP cells with KMUP-1 resulted in cell cycle arrest and apoptotic activities, increasing p21 and p27 and decreasing expressions of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4, CDK2 and CDK6. Moreover, KMUP-1 activated p53, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-3, but reduced the expression of Bcl-2. Regular administration of KMUP-1 suppressed the LNCaP xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. CONCLUSION: These evidences indicate that KMUP-1 and doxazosin inhibit LNCaP cell growth and downregulate expression of AR and PSA. KMUP-1 might be used as a chemoprevention agent for preventing the development of prostate cancer without cardiovascular adverse effect of doxazosin.",exclude
15082280,Effects of aminophylline on cytokines and pulmonary function in patients undergoing valve replacement.,"OBJECTIVE: This study is to evaluate the effects of aminophylline on systemic inflammatory response after cardiopulmonary bypass in patients undergoing valve replacement. METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing elective valve replacement were randomized to receive either aminophylline treatment (aminophylline, n = 15) or no aminophylline (control, n = 15). Administration of aminophylline (5 mg/kg) was injected intravenously after induction of anesthesia and maintained with 0.5 mg/kg per h until the end of cardiopulmonary bypass. Perioperative cytokines (interleukin-8 and interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and respiratory function, blood neutrophil count ratio of right atrium to that of left atrium, plasma malondialdehyde were measured during the experiment. RESULTS: Interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels after cardiopulmonary bypass were significantly lower in the aminophylline group than that in the control group (P < 0.05, for each group), and interleukin-10 level in aminophylline group was significantly higher than in control (P = 0.001). The respiratory index was greater in the control than in aminophylline group (P < 0.05). Neutrophil count ratio of right atrium blood to left atrium blood and plasma malondialdehyde level in aminophylline group were much lower (P = 0.02 and 0.001, respectively) than in the control 30 min after aortic declamping. Compared with control group, the duration of ventilation and intensive care unit stays were shorter in aminophylline group (P = 0.032 and 0.013, respectively).

25157375,Clinical utility of ammonia concentration as a diagnostic test in monitoring of the treatment with L-asparaginase in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"L-asparaginase (ASP) is an enzyme used as one of the basic regimens in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy. Because of the possibility of the enzyme inactivation by antibodies, monitoring of ASP activity is essential. The aim of the study was to examine if plasma concentration of ammonia, a direct product of the reaction catalyzed by ASP, can be used in the assessment of ASP activity. A group of 87 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated in the Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology in Krakow was enrolled to the study. ASP activity and ammonia concentration were measured after ASP administrations during induction. A positive correlation was found between the ammonia concentration and ASP activity (R = 0.44; P < 0.0001) and between the medium values of ammonia concentration and ASP activity (R = 0.56; P < 0.0001). The analysis of ROC curves revealed the moderate accuracy of the ammonia concentration values in the ASP activity assessment. It was also found that the medium value of ammonia concentrations can be useful in identification of the patients with low (<100√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞IU/L) and undetectable (<30√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞IU/L) ASP activity. The plasma ammonia concentration may reflect ASP activity and can be useful when a direct measurement of the activity is unavailable.",exclude
28068938,Acupuncture combined with methylcobalamin for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in patients with multiple myeloma.,"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) seriously affects the quality of life of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) as well as the response rate to chemotherapy. Acupuncture has a potential role in the treatment of CIPN, but at present there have been no randomized clinical research studies to analyze the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of CIPN, particularly in MM patients. METHODS: The MM patients (104 individuals) who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned into a solely methylcobalamin therapy group (500√Ç √é¬ºg intramuscular methylcobalamin injections every other day for 20√Ç days; ten injections) followed by 2√Ç months of 500√Ç √é¬ºg oral methylcobalamin administration, three times per day) and an acupuncture combined with methylcobalamin (Met√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞+√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞Acu) group (methylcobalamin used the same way as above accompanied by three cycles of acupuncture). Of the patients, 98 out of 104 completed the treatment and follow-ups. There were 49 patients in each group. The evaluating parameters included the visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (Fact/GOG-Ntx) questionnaire scores, and electromyographic (EMG) nerve conduction velocity (NCV) determinations. We evaluated the changes of the parameters in each group before and after the therapies and made a comparison between the two groups. RESULTS: After 84√Ç days (three cycles) of therapy, the pain was significantly alleviated in both groups, with a significantly higher decrease in the acupuncture treated group (P√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞<√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞0.01). The patients' daily activity evaluated by Fact/GOG-Ntx questionnaires significantly improved in the Met√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞+√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞Acu group (P√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞<√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞0.001). The NCV in the Met√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞+√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞Acu group improved significantly while amelioration in the control group was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that acupuncture combined with methylcobalamin in the treatment of CIPN showed a better outcome than methylcobalamin administration alone.

This study was performed to demonstrate the noninferiority of monotherapy with piperacillin-tazobactam, compared with cefepime. METHODS: We conducted a randomized-controlled, open-label, multicenter clinical trial among high-risk patients from 34 university-affiliated tertiary care medical centers in the United States, Canada, and Australia who were undergoing treatment for leukemia or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and were hospitalized for empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic episodes. Patients received piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 6 h) or cefepime (2 g every 8 h) intravenously. The primary outcome was success (defined by defervescence without treatment modification) at 72 h of treatment, end of treatment, and test of cure in the modified intent-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included time to defervescence, microbiological efficacy, the additional use of glycopeptide antibiotics, emergence of resistant bacteria, and safety. RESULTS: For 528 subjects (265 received piperacillin-tazobactam and 263 received cefepime), success rates were 57.7% and 48.3%, respectively (P = .04) at the 72-h time point, 39.6% and 31.6% (P = .06) at end of treatment, and 26.8% and 20.5% (P = .11) at the test-of-cure visit. The analyses demonstrated noninferiority for piperacillin-tazobactam at all time points (P< or = .0001). Treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam was independently associated with treatment success in multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.64; P = .035). Both regimens were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the noninferiority and safety of piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy, compared with cefepime, for the empirical treatment of high-risk febrile neutropenic patients with cancer.",exclude
25151488,Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of celecoxib for oral mucositis in patients receiving radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: Oral mucositis (OM) is a painful complication of radiation therapy (RT) for head and neck cancer (H&NC). OM can compromise nutrition, require opioid analgesics and hospitalization for pain control, and lead to treatment interruptions. Based on the role of inflammatory pathways in OM pathogenesis, we investigated effect of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition on severity and morbidity of OM. METHODS: In this double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 40 H&NC patients were randomized to daily use of 200 mg celecoxib or placebo, for the duration of RT. Clinical OM, normalcy of diet, pain scores, and analgesic use were assessed 2-3 times/week by blinded investigators during the 6-7 week RT period, using validated scales. RESULTS: Twenty subjects were randomized to each arm, which were similar with respect to tumor location, radiation dose, and concomitant chemotherapy. In both arms, mucositis and pain scores increased over course of RT. Intention-to-treat analyses demonstrated no significant difference in mean Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale (OMAS) scores at 5000 cGy (primary endpoint). There was also no difference between the two arms in mean OMAS scores over the period of RT, mean worst pain scores, mean normalcy of diet scores, or mean daily opioid medication use in IV morphine equivalents. There were no adverse events attributed to celecoxib use. CONCLUSIONS: Daily use of a selective COX-2 inhibitor, during period of RT for H&NC, did not reduce the severity of clinical OM, pain, dietary compromise or use of opioid analgesics. These findings also have implications for celecoxib use in H&NC treatment regimens (NCT00698204).",exclude
26716866,Effects of dexmedetomidine on oxygenation and lung mechanics in patients with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease undergoing lung cancer surgery: A randomised double-blinded trial.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a risk factor that increases the incidence of postoperative cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality after lung resection. Dexmedetomidine, a selective √é¬±2-adrenoreceptor agonist, has been reported previously to attenuate intrapulmonary shunt during one-lung ventilation (OLV) and to alleviate bronchoconstriction. OBJECTIVE: The objective is to determine whether dexmedetomidine improves oxygenation and lung mechanics in patients with moderate COPD during lung cancer surgery. DESIGN: A randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Single university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty patients scheduled for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery who had moderate COPD. Patients were randomly allocated to a control group or a Dex group (n√¢‚Ç¨≈†=√¢‚Ç¨≈†25 each). INTERVENTIONS: In the Dex group, dexmedetomidine was given as an initial loading dose of 1.0 √¢‚Ç¨≈†√é¬ºg √¢‚Ç¨≈†kg(-1) over 10√¢‚Ç¨≈† min followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5 √¢‚Ç¨≈†√é¬ºg √¢‚Ç¨≈†kg(-1) √¢‚Ç¨≈†h(-1) during OLV while the control group was administered a comparable volume of 0.9% saline. Data were measured at 30 √¢‚Ç¨≈†min (DEX-30) and 60 √¢‚Ç¨≈†min (DEX-60) after dexmedetomidine or saline administration during OLV. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the effect of dexmedetomidine on oxygenation. The secondary outcome was the effect of dexmedetomidine administration on postoperative pulmonary complications. RESULTS: Patients in the Dex group had a significantly higher PaO2/FIO2 ratio (27.9√¢‚Ç¨≈†√Ç¬±√¢‚Ç¨≈†5.8 vs. 22.5√¢‚Ç¨≈†√Ç¬±√¢‚Ç¨≈†8.4 and 28.6√¢‚Ç¨≈†√Ç¬±√¢‚Ç¨≈†5.9 vs. 21.0√¢‚Ç¨≈†√Ç¬±√¢‚Ç¨≈†9.9 kPa, P√¢‚Ç¨≈†<√¢‚Ç¨≈†0.05), significantly lower dead space ventilation (19.2√¢‚Ç¨≈†√Ç¬±√¢‚Ç¨≈†8.5 vs. 24.1√¢‚Ç¨≈†√Ç¬±√¢‚Ç¨≈†8.1 and 19.6√¢‚Ç¨≈†√Ç¬±√¢‚Ç¨≈†6.7 vs. 25.3√¢‚Ç¨≈†√Ç¬±√¢‚Ç¨≈†7.8%, P√¢‚Ç¨≈†<√¢‚Ç¨≈†0.05) and higher dynamic compliance at DEX-30 and DEX-60 (P√¢‚Ç¨≈†=√¢‚Ç¨≈†0.0001 and P√¢‚Ç¨≈†=√¢‚Ç¨≈†0.0184) compared with the control group. In the Dex group, the PaO2/FIO2 ratio in the postoperative period was significantly higher (P√¢‚Ç¨≈†=√¢‚Ç¨≈†0.022) and the incidence of ICU admission was lower than in the control group.

24702571,Effect of intrathecal dexmedetomidine on spinal morphine analgesia in patients with refractory cancer pain.,"BACKGROUND: Systemic administration of dexmedetomidine has been shown to reduce opioid consumption and improve analgesia satisfaction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of intrathecal dexmedetomidine on spinal morphine analgesia in patients with refractory cancer pain. METHODS: A double-blinded crossover study was designed and performed. Patients were randomly allocated in one of the two phases. Phase M received intrathecal morphine administration. Phase M+D received intrathecal morphine plus dexmedetomidine administration. All patients were monitored for 7 days and crossed over to alternate phase for another 1-week observation. Daily average visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, pain frequency, sleep deprivation, daily morphine consumption, bolus dose injection times, and side effects were all recorded. RESULTS: Pain intensity and frequency were significantly decreased in both phases compared with baseline. Daily morphine consumption and bolus dose injection times during phase M+D were significantly decreased compared with phase M. The incidences of constipation were significantly reduced in both phases compared with baseline administration, but nausea and vomiting were significantly increased. No serious side effects such as respiratory inhibition were observed in this study.

The PTH type 1 receptor agonist abaloparatide, selected for its bone anabolic activity, is under clinical development to treat postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. To determine the carcinogenic potential of abaloparatide, Fischer (F344) rats were administered SC daily abaloparatide at doses of 0, 10, 25, and 50¬†Œºg/kg or 30¬†Œºg/kg hPTH(1-34) as a positive control for up to 2 years. Robust increases in bone density were achieved at all abaloparatide doses and with hPTH(1-34). Comprehensive histopathological analysis reflected a comparable continuum of proliferative changes in bone, mostly osteosarcoma, in both abaloparatide and hPTH(1-34) treated rats. Comparing the effects of abaloparatide and hPTH(1-34) at the 25 and 30¬†Œºg/kg respective doses, representing similar exposure multiples to the human therapeutic doses, revealed similar osteosarcoma-associated mortality, tumor incidence, age at first occurrence, and metastatic potential. There were no increases in the incidence of non-bone tumors with abaloparatide compared to vehicle. Thus, near life-long treatment with abaloparatide in rats resulted in dose and time dependent formation of osteosarcomas, with a comparable response to hPTH(1-34) at similar exposure.",exclude

Human gastric cancer MKN‚Äë28 cells, as a model in¬†vitro, were treated with aclidinium bromide and dimethyl sulfoxide. Cell Counting Kit‚Äë8 assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry were used to assess cell proliferation, invasion/migration and apoptosis, respectively. In addition, western blotting was performed to determine the relative expression of proteins associated with apoptosis and the phosphatidylinositol‚Äë3‚Äëkinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. Optical density values of MKN‚Äë28 cells were decreased in a time‚Äë and dose‚Äëdependent manner in the aclidinium bromide treated group. Matrigel invasion analysis demonstrated the number of invasive cells were significantly decreased in the aclidinium bromide‚Äëtreated group when compared with the control group. Furthermore, aclidinium bromide led to the marked reduction of the number of MKN‚Äë28 cells passing though the microwells of the transwell chamber. The expression levels of the anti‚Äëapoptotic protein B‚Äëcell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‚Äë2) decreased, and the expression of pro‚Äëapoptotic proteins active Caspase3 and Bcl‚Äë2‚Äëassociated X protein increased concurrently following aclidinium bromide stimulation using western blotting. The phosphorylation of protein kinase B and mechanistic target of rapamycin were significantly inhibited in MKN‚Äë28 cells treated with aclidinium bromide; and the activity of the downstream proteins such as p70S6K and Cyclin¬†D1 were also significantly decreased. In conclusion, aclidinium bromide could inhibit gastric cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, which may be associated with the enhancement of apoptosis induced by the PI3K signaling pathway.",include

Phase II and III trials have not demonstrated efficacy of recently developed reagents, compared with gemcitabine alone; new chemotherapic agents are needed. Ninety percent of pancreatic tumors have telomerase activity, and expression correlates with tumor stage. We developed a thymidine analogue prodrug, acycloguanosyl 5'-thymidyltriphosphate (ACV-TP-T), that is metabolized by telomerase and releases the active form of acyclovir. We investigated the antitumor efficacy of ACV-TP-T in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: We evaluated proliferation and apoptosis of human pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1, MiaPaca2, BxPc3, PL45, and Su.86.86) incubated with ACV-TP-T. The presence of ACV-TP-T and its metabolite inside the cells were analyzed by mass spectrometry. In vivo efficacy was evaluated in nude mice carrying PANC-1 or MiaPaca2 pancreatic xenograft tumors. RESULTS: The prodrug of ACV-TP-T was actively metabolized inside pancreatic cancer cells into the activated form of acyclovir; proliferation was reduced, apoptosis was increased, and the cell cycle was altered in pancreatic cancer incubated with ACV-TP-T, compared with controls. Administration of ACV-TP-T to mice reduced growth, increased apoptosis, and reduced proliferation and vascularization of pancreatic xenograft tumors.

25890381,Albumin nanoparticles increase the anticancer efficacy of albendazole in ovarian cancer xenograft model.,"BACKGROUND: The poor prognosis of patients with drug resistant ovarian cancer and the lack of targeted therapy have raised the need for alternative treatments. Albendazole (ABZ) is an anti-parasite compound capable of impairing microtubule formation. We hypothesized that ABZ could be repurposed as a potential anti-angiogenic drug due to its potent inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in ovarian cancer with ascites. However, the poor aqueous solubility of ABZ limits its potential for cancer therapy. In this study, we have assembled ABZ with bovine serum albumin into nanoparticles with a size range of 7-10 nm (BSA-ABZ) and 200-250 nm (Nab-ABZ). We further examined the anticancer effects of ABZ carrying nanoparticles in ovarian cancer cells, in both in vitro and in vivo models. RESULTS: Drug release studies demonstrated that about 93% of ABZ was released from BSA-ABZ 10 nm in comparison to 83% from Nab-ABZ 200 nm at pH 7.4 in 8 days. In vitro cell proliferation studies showed that the BSA-ABZ 10 nm exhibited the highest killing efficacy of ovarian cancer cells with surprisingly least toxicity to healthy ovarian epithelial cells. Confocal microscopy and fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis (FACS) revealed more efficient internalization of the BSA-ABZ 10 nm by cancer cells. For in vivo studies, we examined the tumor growth, ascites formation and the expression of VEGF and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) in tumor samples and only VEGF in plasma samples. The BSA-ABZ 10 nm reduced the tumor burden significantly (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.02) at a much lower drug dose (10 Œºg/ml) compare to free drug. Both formulations were capable of suppressing the ascites volume significantly (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) and reducing the number of ascites cells. The expression of VEGF and SPARC was also reduced, which indicates the underlying therapeutic mechanism of the ABZ. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the BSA-ABZ may hold promise for the treatment and control of progression of ovarian cancer with ascites. However further studies are required to examine the efficacy of both the formulations in aggressive models of recurrent ovarian cancer with respect to particle size and dosing parameters.",exclude
26201988,Amantadine inhibits cellular proliferation and induces the apoptosis of hepatocellular cancer cells in vitro.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive malignancies worldwide, and its incidence associated with viral infection has increased in recent years. Amantadine is a tricyclic symmetric amine that can effectively protect against the hepatitis C virus. However, its antitumor properties remain unclear. In the present study, the effects of amantadine on tumor cell viability, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis were investigated. The growth of HepG2 and SMMC‚Äë7721 cells (HCC cell lines) was detected by an MTT assay. Flow cytometry was used to investigate cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Reverse transcription‚Äëquantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were also performed to examine the expression of cell cycle‚Äë and apoptosis‚Äërelated genes and proteins, including cyclin E, cyclin D1, cyclin‚Äëdependent kinase 2 (CDK2), B‚Äëcell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‚Äë2) and Bax.

The levels of the cell cycle‚Äërelated genes and proteins (cyclin D1, cyclin E and CDK2) were reduced by amantadine, and apoptosis was significantly induced. Amantadine treatment also reduced Bcl‚Äë2 and increased the Bax protein and mRNA levels. Additionally, Bcl‚Äë2/Bax ratios were lower in the two HCC cell lines following amantadine treatment.

Oral administration of amitriptyline significantly decreased tumor growth in two MM xenograft models derived from murine and human MM cells, respectively. Molecular pathological analysis showed that amitriptyline induced p53, activated caspase-3, and decreased antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 in tumor tissues. Amitriptyline also significantly extended the survival period of MM-tumor-bearing mice. In the in-vitro study, we also found that amitriptyline synergistically induced MM cell apoptosis in combination with bortezomib, the most potent anti-MM agent.

26500238,IL1 Receptor Antagonist Inhibits Pancreatic Cancer Growth by Abrogating NF-Œ∫B Activation.,"PURPOSE: Constitutive NF-Œ∫B activation is identified in about 70% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cases and is required for oncogenic KRAS-induced PDAC development in mouse models. We sought to determine whether targeting IL-1Œ± pathway would inhibit NF-Œ∫B activity and thus suppress PDAC cell growth. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We determined whether anakinra, a human IL-1 receptor (rhIL-1R) antagonist, inhibited NF-Œ∫B activation. Assays for cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were performed with rhIL-1R antagonist using the human PDAC cell lines AsPc1, Colo357, MiaPaCa-2, and HPNE/K-ras(G12V)/p16sh. In vivo NF-Œ∫B activation-dependent tumorigenesis was assayed using an orthotopic nude mouse model (n = 20, 5 per group) treated with a combination of gemcitabine and rhIL-1RA. RESULTS: rhIL-1R antagonist treatment led to a significant decrease in NF-Œ∫B activity. PDAC cells treated with rhIL-1R antagonist plus gemcitabine reduced proliferation, migration, and invasion as compared with single gemcitabine treatment. In nude mice, rhIL-1R antagonist plus gemcitabine significantly reduced the tumor burden (gemcitabine plus rhIL-1RA vs. control, P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: We found that anakinra, an FDA-approved drug that inhibits IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), when given with or without gemcitabine, can reduce tumor growth by inhibiting IL1Œ±-induced NF-Œ∫B activity; this result suggests that it is a useful therapeutic approach for PDAC.",include
24412605,Hepatoblastoma cells express truncated neurokinin-1 receptor and can be growth inhibited by aprepitant in vitro and in vivo.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Multidrug resistance presents a major problem in hepatoblastoma (HB), and new anti-tumor strategies are desperately needed. The substance P (SP)/neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) complex has been discovered to be pivotal in the development of a variety of human cancers, and NK1R antagonists, such as the clinical drug aprepitant, are promising future anticancer agents. Yet, the role of the SP/NK1R complex as a potential anticancer target in HB is unknown. METHODS: Human HB cell lines HepT1, HepG2, and HuH6, human tumor samples from 17 children with HB as well as mice xenografted with human HB cell line HuH6 were analyzed regarding the SP/NK1R complex as a potential new anti-tumor target in HB. RESULTS: Therapeutic targeting with the NK1R antagonists aprepitant, L-733,060, and L-732,138 led to growth inhibition and apoptosis in HepT1, HepG2, and HuH6 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Intriguingly, HB cells predominantly expressed the truncated splice variant of NK1R. Human fibroblasts showed only dismal NK1R expression and were significantly more resistant. Stimulation of HB cells with SP, NK1R's natural ligand, caused increased growth rates and abrogated the anti-proliferative effect of NK1R antagonists. Expression analysis of 17 human HB samples confirmed the clinical relevance of NK1R. Most importantly, oral treatment of a HuH6 xenograft mouse model with 80mg/kg/day aprepitant for 24days resulted in a striking reduction of tumor growth, as evidenced by reduced tumor volume and weight, lowered tumor-specific alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) serum levels, and decreased number of Ki-67 positive cells. Furthermore, aprepitant treatment inhibited in vivo angiogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we describe the NK1R in its truncated splice variant as a potent target in human HB and an inhibitory effect in vivo and in vitro by NK1R antagonists. Therefore, NK1R antagonists should be considered promising new candidates for innovative therapeutic strategies against HB.",include

The pharmacological effects of ARP on cancer cells are still poorly understood. In this study, anti-cancer effects of ARP on various malignant tumor cells and its molecular mechanism were further carefully examined by using cell proliferation assay, xenograft mouse model, immunoblotting analysis, migration assay, luciferase reporter gene assay, kinase assay, and overexpression strategy. Treatment with ARP induced cytotoxicity in U251 glioma cells, MKN-1 gastric adenosquamous carcinoma cells, and CT26 colon carcinoma cells. ARP suppressed cell proliferation of LN428, MDA-MB-231, and HEK293 cells. Pro-apoptotic factors active caspase-3, -8, and -9, as well as p53, were upregulated, whereas the protein and mRNA levels of anti-apoptotic factor B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) decreased. In agreement with the <i>in vitro</i> results, ARP compound also significantly suppressed the growth of tumor masses formed by injecting CT26 colon cancer cells into mice. ARP treatment also effectively decreased the migratory ability of U251 glioma cells by downregulating metalloproteinase-9. Levels of phosphorylated Src, phosphorylated phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were significantly decreased following ARP treatment.

27656712,Clinical picture of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and its differentiation from non-HIT thrombocytopenia.,"HIT is an acquired antibody-mediated disorder strongly associated with thrombosis, including microthrombosis secondary to disseminated intravascular dissemination (DIC). The clinical features of HIT are reviewed from the perspective of the 4Ts scoring system for HIT, which emphasises its characteristic timing of onset of thrombocytopenia. HIT antibodies recognize multimolecular complexes of platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin. However, a subset of HIT sera recognise PF4 bound to platelet chondroitin sulfate; these antibodies activate platelets in vitro and in vivo even in the absence of heparin, thus explaining: delayed-onset HIT (where HIT begins or worsens after stopping heparin); persisting HIT (where HIT takes several weeks to recover); spontaneous HIT syndrome (a disorder clinically and serologically resembling HIT but without proximate heparin exposure); and fondaparinux-associated HIT (four distinct syndromes featuring thrombocytopenia that begins or worsens during treatment with fondaparinux), with a new patient case presented with ongoing thrombocytopenia (and fatal haemorrhage) during treatment of HIT with fondaparinux, with fondaparinux-dependent platelet activation induced by patient serum (""fondaparinux cross-reactivity""). Ironically, despite existence of fondaparinux-associated HIT, this pentasaccharide anticoagulant is a frequent treatment for HIT (including one used by the author). HIT can be confused with other disorders, including those with a) timing similar to HIT (e.‚Äâg. abciximab-associated thrombocytopenia of delayed-onset); b) combined thrombocytopenia/thrombosis (e.‚Äâg. symmetrical peripheral gangrene secondary to acute DIC and shock liver); and c) both timing of onset and thrombosis (e.‚Äâg. warfarin-associated venous limb gangrene complicating cancer-associated DIC).

METHODS: 58 children with congenital heart diseases, including atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and atrioventricular septal defect, scheduled to undergo CPB, aged 4 - 72 months, were randomly divided into 4 groups: alprostadil Group P (n = 15) receiving alprostadil 10 ng/ml added into the prime solution and continuous pump infusion of alprostadil 10 ngxkg(-1)xmin(-1) via central vein until the end of operation, Group U (n = 15) receiving ulinastatin 20 000 U/kg divided into several doses to be added into the prime solution, Group PU (n = 14) receiving alprostadil and ulinastatin according to the above protocols, and Group C (control group, n = 14) receiving normal saline of the equal volume. Electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate (HR), pulse oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were continuously monitored during operation. Duration of mechanical ventilation and staying in ICU were also recorded. Plasma neutrophil (PMN), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9) levels in the radial arterial blood samples were measured after induction of anesthesia before CPB (T(1)), 30 minutes and (T(2)), 2 hours (T(3)), 6 hours (T(4)), and 24 hours (T(5)) after the declamping of aorta. Inhaled oxygen concentration and arterial blood gas analysis were recorded at T(1), T(2), and T(3) for calculation of oxygenation index (OI). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the MAP and HR among these four groups at any time points (all P > 0.05). The umbers of PMN and the levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha at T(2) and T(3) of Groups P, U, and PU were all significantly lower than that of Group C (all P < 0.05), with those of Group PU being the lowest. The IL-10 levels at T(2) and T(3) of Groups U and PU were significantly higher than that of Group C (both P < 0.05), the level of MMP-9 at T(2) and T(3) of Groups U and PU were significantly lower than that of Group C (all P < 0.05), however, there was not significant difference between Group P and Group C (P > 0.05). The OIs at T(2) of Groups P, U, and PU were significantly higher than that of Group C (all P < 0.05). The mechanical ventilation time of Groups P, U, and PU were all significantly shorter than that of Group C, and that of Group PU was significantly shorter than that of group C (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Decreasing the inflammatory response after CPB, alprostadil and ulinastatin used during CPB effectively reduce the pulmonary injury via inhibition of the neutrophil activation and cytokines release.",exclude

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of alvimopan to accelerate GI recovery after RC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in patients undergoing RC and receiving postoperative intravenous patient-controlled opioid analgesics. INTERVENTION: Oral alvimopan 12 mg (maximum: 15 inpatient doses) versus placebo. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The two-component primary end point was time to upper (first tolerance of solid food) and lower (first bowel movement) GI recovery (GI-2). Time to discharge order written, postoperative LOS, postoperative ileus (POI)-related morbidity, opioid consumption, and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated. An independent adjudication of cardiovascular AEs was performed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Patients were randomized to alvimopan (n=143) or placebo (n=137); 277 patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. The alvimopan cohort experienced quicker GI-2 recovery (5.5 vs 6.8 d; hazard ratio: 1.8; p<0.0001), shorter mean LOS (7.4 vs 10.1 d; p=0.0051), and fewer episodes of POI-related morbidity (8.4% vs 29.1%; p<0.001). The incidence of opioid consumption and AEs or serious AEs (SAEs) was comparable except for POI, which was lower in the alvimopan group (AEs: 7% vs 26%; SAEs: 5% vs 20%, respectively). Cardiovascular AEs occurred in 8.4% (alvimopan) and 15.3% (placebo) of patients (p=0.09). Generalizability may be limited due to the exclusion of epidural analgesia and the inclusion of mostly high-volume centers utilizing open laparotomy. CONCLUSIONS: Alvimopan is a useful addition to a standardized care pathway in patients undergoing RC by accelerating GI recovery and shortening LOS, with a safety profile similar to placebo. PATIENT SUMMARY: This study examined the effects of alvimopan on bowel recovery in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer. Patients receiving alvimopan experienced quicker bowel recovery and had a shorter hospital stay compared with those who received placebo, with comparable safety.

21292169,"A randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (Study SB-767905/012) of alvimopan for opioid-induced bowel dysfunction in patients with non-cancer pain.","UNLABELLED: Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects are common with opioid medication, and constipation affects ‚àº40% of patients. Such symptoms considerably impair patients' quality of life. Alvimopan is an orally administered, systemically available, peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor (PAM-OR) antagonist approved in the US for short-term, in-hospital management of postoperative ileus in patients undergoing bowel resection. This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted as part of a recently discontinued clinical program, in which alvimopan was being developed for opioid-induced constipation (OIC). Patients (N = 518) receiving opioids for non-cancer pain were randomized to receive alvimopan .5 mg once daily, alvimopan .5 mg twice daily, or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients experiencing ‚â• 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs; bowel movements with no laxative use in the previous 24 hours) per week over the treatment period and an average increase from baseline of ‚â• 1 SBM per week. A significantly greater proportion of patients in the alvimopan .5 mg twice-daily group met the primary endpoint compared with placebo (72% versus 48%, P < .001). Treatment with alvimopan twice daily improved a number of other symptoms compared with placebo and reduced the requirement for rescue laxative use. The opioid-induced bowel dysfunction Symptoms Improvement Scale (SIS) responder rate was 40.4% in the alvimopan .5 mg twice daily group, versus 18.6% with placebo (P < .001). In general, alvimopan .5 mg once daily produced qualitatively similar but numerically smaller responses than twice-daily treatment. Active treatment did not increase the requirement for opioid medication or increase average pain intensity scores. Over the 12-week treatment period, alvimopan appeared to be well tolerated. PERSPECTIVE: These results demonstrate the potential for a PAM-OR antagonist to improve the symptoms of OIC without antagonizing opioid analgesia.",exclude
21292168,"A randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial (Study SB-767905/013) of alvimopan for opioid-induced bowel dysfunction in patients with non-cancer pain.","UNLABELLED: The balance between the pain relief provided by opioid analgesics and the side effects caused by such agents is of particular significance to patients who take opioids for the long-term relief of non-cancer pain. The spectrum of signs and symptoms affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract associated with opioid use is known as opioid-induced bowel dysfunction. Alvimopan is an orally administered, systemically available, peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor (PAM-OR) antagonist, approved in the US for the management of postoperative ileus in patients undergoing bowel resection (short-term, in-hospital use only). Alvimopan was under clinical development for long-term treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) but this program has been discontinued. This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, part of the former OIC development program, enrolled patients (N = 485) receiving opioids for non-cancer pain. Patients were randomized to receive alvimopan .5 mg once daily, alvimopan .5 mg twice daily, or placebo, for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who experienced ‚â• 3 spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs; bowel movements with no laxative use in the previous 24 hours) per week over the treatment period, and an average increase from baseline of ‚â• 1 SBM per week. There were greater proportions of SBM responders in both alvimopan treatment groups (63% in both groups) compared with placebo (56%), although these differences were not statistically significant. Secondary efficacy analyses indicated that alvimopan was numerically superior to placebo in improving opioid-induced bowel dysfunction symptoms and patients' global assessment of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, and reduced the requirement for rescue laxatives. Active treatment was well tolerated and alvimopan did not antagonize opioid analgesia. PERSPECTIVE: Although the primary endpoint was not met in this study, the magnitude of alvimopan-induced improvements versus baseline, together with previous study results, suggest that a PAM-OR antagonist has the potential to improve OIC.",exclude
19597646,Cefepime monotherapy is as effective as ceftriaxone plus amikacin in pediatric patients with cancer and high-risk febrile neutropenia in a randomized comparison.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The empirical use of antibiotic therapy is widely accepted for patients with fever and neutropenia during cancer chemotherapy. The use of intravenous monotherapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients at high risk for complications is an appropriate alternative. However, few data are available for pediatric patients. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of cefepime (CFP) monotherapy with ceftriaxone plus amikacin (CFT+AK) in children and adolescents with febrile neutropenia (FN). METHODS: A prospective randomized open study of patients with lymphoma or leukemia who had fever and neutropenia during chemotherapy was conducted. Patients were randomized to receive CFP or CFT+AK. The randomization was based on number lists. RESULTS: Fifty seven patients with 125 episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated (CFP, 62 episodes; CFT+AK, 63 episodes). The mean neutrophil count at admission to hospital was 118.6 cells/mm(3) for patients in the CFP group and 107 cells/mm(3) for patients in the CFT+AK group. The mean duration of neutropenia was 9 days for the CFP group and 8 days for the CFT+AK group. Analysis of only the first episodes for each patient showed that CFP treatment was successful for 65.5% of episodes and CFT+AK was successful for 64.3% of episodes. The overall rates of success with modification were 90% for the CFP group and 89% for the CFT+AK group. No major treatment-emergent toxicity was reported. CONCLUSION: Monotherapy with CFP seems to be as effective and safe as CFT+AK for initial empirical therapy in children and adolescents with FN.",exclude

Children with AL who had febrile neutropenic episodes were randomized to treatment with PIP/TAZO versus PIP/TAZO plus amikacin. Modification was defined as addition of other antimicrobials and/or antifungal agents to the empirical therapy. Protocol failure was defined as withdrawal of the empirical regimen and introduction of other antimicrobials due to failure in controlling infection. Seventy-two febrile episodes of 42 patients with a median age of 4.5 years (3.5 months to 19 years) were evaluated. There were 37 and 35 episodes in PIP/TAZO and combination arms, respectively. Success without modification, with modification, protocol failure, duration of treatment were 45.9%, 35.1%, 18.9%, and 10 days in PIP/TAZO arm and 42.9%, 37.1%, 20%, and 12 days in combination arm, respectively (P > .05). There was no significant difference between the empirical therapy arms regarding median duration of neutropenia and defervescence of fever. Empirical therapy was substituted by other drugs in 6 and 5 episodes in PIP/TAZO and combination arms, respectively. There was no infection-related death. There was reversible increase in serum creatinine in 1 episode on the combination arm. Monotherapy with PIP/TAZO was effective and safe for initial empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic episodes in children with AL. However, local bacterial resistance patterns should be considered in daily practice.

Patients aged 2-16 years with hematological malignancies who had febrile neutropenia were randomly assigned to receive piperacillin/tazobactam (80 mg/kg piperacillin/10 mg/kg tazobactam, q6h) combined with amikacin (PTA) (7.5 mg/kg, q12h) or meropenem or imipenem (20 mg/kg, q8h) (C). Response to antimicrobial therapy, evaluated for etiological agents, was measured. Duration of fever, neutropenia, and hospitalization, mortality, and the need for additional antibiotics or antifungal drugs were compared for the treatment success between the two groups. Out of 87 febrile neutropenic episodes that were evaluable for comparison, 46 patients received PTA and 41 patients were treated with carbapenems (imipenem or meropenem). Overall, the microbiologically documented infection rate was 21.9%, with Staphylococcus epidermidis as the most common cause of bacteremia. The rate of treatment modification was 56.5% in the PTA group and 53.6% in the carbapenem group with no statistical difference (p > .05). There was no infection-related mortality during the study period.

So the aim of the study was to evaluate comparative clinical efficacy of pregabaline with amitriptyline and gabapentin in neuropathic cancer pain. A total of 120 patients with cancer having severe neuropathic cancer pain were enrolled in the study after taking approval from Institutional Ethics Committee and divided in to 4 groups: group AT-amitriptyline, group GB-gabapentin, group PG-pregabalin, and group PL-placebo. Oral morphine was used for rescue analgesic for continued pain. Pain score (Visual Analogue scale) and secondary outcome measures such as intensity of lancinating, dysesthesia, and burning on numerical rating scale, Global satisfaction score (GSS), Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group scoring (ECOG), and adverse effects were assessed. At the end of study there was significant decrease in pain score in group PG as compared to the other groups; group AT (P = .003), group GB (P = .042), and group PL (P = .024). Percentage of patients with lancinating pain and dysesthesia were significantly less in group PG as compared to groups GB and PL. All the patients in group PL needed rescue morphine. After 4 visits, maximum improvement in ECOG scoring and GSS scoring was observed in group PG patients.

After introduction of a new standard and intermediate-risk ALL treatment protocol with prolonged continuous ASP treatment, two symptomatic DVTs in 10 patients were observed at the Children's Hospital, Helsinki, Finland. To prevent further thrombotic complications yet ensuring continuous exposure to ASP, an AT substitution strategy was adopted in Helsinki. The same ALL treatment protocol is used without AT substitution in the other Nordic countries. In this retrospective study, we describe the effect of prolonged ASP treatment on AT and fibrinogen levels in children without AT substitution in Stockholm, Sweden (n = 39) and the AT substitution in children with AT activity below 0.55 kIU/l in Helsinki (n = 36, intervention group). The intervention group is compared with children treated similarly earlier in Helsinki without AT substitution (n = 10). The median lowest AT activity during the ASP treatment without AT substitution was 0.55 kIU/l. Fibrinogen level of 1.0 g/l or less was found in 14% of all routine samples during the ASP treatment. In the intervention group, 23 (64%) received AT concentrate. Two (20%) children had symptomatic DVT before initiation of the AT substitution and two (6%) thereafter. We conclude that most children are exposed to low AT activity during ASP treatment predisposing to thrombosis. The effect of prophylactic AT substitution remains unclear.",exclude

The study is an investigator-initiated, multi-national, prospective, randomized, open-label with blind end-point evaluation (PROBE), non-inferiority clinical trial (NCT03045406). Consecutive patients are randomized to receive oral apixaban or subcutaneous dalteparin for 6 months. Apixaban is given at a dose of 10‚Äâmg twice daily for the first 7 days and then 5‚Äâmg twice daily; dalteparin is given at a dose of 200 IU/kg for the first month and then 150 IU/kg once daily. The primary outcome of the study is objectively confirmed recurrent VTE as assessed by a central independent adjudication committee unaware of study treatment allocation. The primary safety outcome is major bleeding defined according to the guidelines of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis.

22104410,An open trial of aripiprazole for the treatment of delirium in hospitalized cancer patients.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in the treatment of delirium in hospitalized cancer patients, and to examine differential responses based on delirium subtypes. METHOD: We conducted an analysis of 21 hospitalized cancer patients at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) who had been evaluated and treated for delirium with aripiprazole, using an MSKCC Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved Clinical Delirium Database. Measures used were the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS), the Karnofsky Scale of Performance Status (KPS), and side effect rating at baseline (T1), 2-3 days (T2), and 4-7 days (T3). All measurements were integrated into the routine clinical care of patients. Doses of aripiprazole were adjusted based on clinical response. RESULTS: Patients treated for delirium with aripiprazole experienced significant improvement and resolution of delirium, with MDAS scores declining from a mean of 18.0 at baseline (T1) to mean of 10.8 at T2 and a mean of 8.3 at T3. KPS scores improved from 28.1 at baseline (T1) to 35.2 at T2 and 41 at T3. Delirium resolved (based on MDAS < 10) in 52.4% of cases at T2 and in 76.2% at T3. The mean dosage of aripiprazole required was 18.3 mg (range of 5-30) daily at T3. In our cohort of patients with hypoactive delirium, we observed a delirium resolution rate of 100% compared to the cohort of patients with hyperactive delirium (58.3% rate of delirium resolution). MDAS scores improved from 15.6 at T1 to 5.7 at T3 in hypoactive delirium and from 19.9 at T1 to 10.2 at T3 in hyperactive delirium. In patients with pre-morbid cognitive deficits and the hyperactive subtype of delirium, we observed a more limited treatment response to aripiprazole treatment for delirium. There were no clinically significant side effects noted. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Aripiprazole is effective and safe in the treatment of delirium in hospitalized cancer patients. These preliminary finding suggest that aripiprazole may be most effective in resolving delirium of the hypoactive subtype.",exclude
28105576,Effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and armodafinil on quality of life in cancer survivors: a randomized placebo-controlled trial.,"PURPOSE: Cancer-related insomnia is associated with diminished quality of life (QOL), suggesting that improvement in insomnia may improve QOL in cancer survivors. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown to improve insomnia, but less is known regarding its effect on QOL and whether improvement in insomnia corresponds to improved QOL. The present analysis examines the effects of CBT-I, with and without armodafinil, on QOL both directly and indirectly through improvements of insomnia. METHODS: This is an analysis of 95 cancer survivors for a specified secondary aim of a four-arm randomized controlled trial assessing the combined and individual effects of CBT-I and armodafinil to improve insomnia. QOL and insomnia severity were assessed before, during the intervention, at post-intervention, and 3¬†months later by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General and Insomnia Severity Index, respectively. RESULTS: Mean change in QOL from pre- to post-intervention for CBT-I + placebo, CBT-I + armodafinil, armodafinil, and placebo was 9.6 (SE¬†=¬†1.8; p¬†<¬†0.0001), 11.6 (SE¬†=¬†1.8; p¬†<¬†0.0001), -0.2 (SE¬†=¬†3.2; p¬†=¬†0.964), and 3.3 (SE¬†=¬†2.0; p¬†=¬†0.124), respectively. ANCOVA controlling for pre-intervention scores showed that participants receiving CBT-I had significantly improved QOL at post-intervention compared to those not receiving CBT-I (p¬†<¬†0.0001, effect size¬†=¬†0.57), with benefits being maintained at the 3-month follow-up. Path analysis revealed that this improvement in QOL was due to improvement in insomnia severity (p¬†=¬†0.002), and Pearson correlations showed that changes in QOL from pre- to post-intervention were significantly associated with concurrent changes in insomnia severity (r¬†=¬†-0.56; p¬†<¬†0.0001). Armodafinil had no effect on QOL for those who did or did not receive it (p¬†=¬†0.976; effect size¬†=¬†-0.004). CONCLUSION: In cancer survivors with insomnia, CBT-I resulted in clinically significant improvement in QOL via improvement in insomnia. This improvement in QOL remained stable even 3¬†months after completing CBT-I. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Considering the high prevalence of insomnia and its detrimental impact on QOL in cancer survivors and the effectiveness of CBT-I in alleviating insomnia, it is important that evidence-based non-pharmacological sleep interventions such as CBT-I be provided as an integral part of cancer care.",exclude

Glycopyrrolate and atropine as adjuncts to reversal of neuromuscular blockers have differential inhibitory effects on muscarinic receptors. This study was conducted to compare the effect of glycopyrrolate versus atropine on postoperative CRBD in patients undergoing transurethral resection of a bladder tumor (TURBT). METHODS: Seventy-four patients undergoing TURBT were randomly allocated to receive either glycopyrrolate 10 Œºg/kg (glycopyrrolate group, n = 37) or atropine 15 Œºg/kg (atropine group, n = 37) in combination with neostigmine 25 Œºg/kg at the end of surgery for reversal of neuromuscular blockade. The incidence and severity (mild/moderate/severe) of CRBD were assessed at 0, 1, 6, and 24 h postoperatively. Tramadol 50-100 mg was administered intravenously if the patients complained of moderate or severe CRBD. RESULTS: The incidence of CRBD was significantly lower in the glycopyrrolate group than in the atropine group at 0 h (65 % vs. 89 %, p = 0.025) and 1 h (54 % vs. 89 %, p = 0.002) postoperatively. The severity of postoperative CRBD was less severe in the glycopyrrolate group than in the atropine group at 0 h (p = 0.013) and 1 h (p = 0.006). Fewer patients required tramadol in the glycopyrrolate group than in the atropine group (3 % vs. 12 %, p = 0.024).

In the 2nd cycle, T was administered together with D and during the 3rd cycle, T was combined with A and continued with T over the ensuing 3 days post-chemotherapy. Stress was present in 23 women and was evaluated for its impact on antiemetic response. Differences in the emetogenic response were found for nausea and vomiting mainly with the addition of A. The combination of T+A was superior to T and T+D in acute emesis (P<0.001). Concerning delayed emesis, differences were detected with both T+D and T+A (being equally effective) and superior to T alone (P<0.001). The emetogenic potential was decreased by the addition of A in comparison to T alone (P=0.001). Patients without stress had no difference, while patients with stress had a significantly better antiemetic result with the addition of D or A to T. In conclusion, T provides a satisfactory result in controlling nausea and emesis caused by moderately emetogenic CT regimens. Addition of D or A improves the antiemetic effect, and A provides better coverage in women with stress, a finding worth exploration in larger confirmatory studies.",exclude

It is featured with swelling, redness, itching, pain, breaks in skin, discomfort, and a burning sensation. There is a lack of convincing evidence supporting any single practice in the prevention or management of RISR. METHODS/DESIGNS: This double-blinded randomised controlled trial aims to investigate the effects of a natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin (as known as Moogoo Udder Cream¬Æ) versus aqueous cream in reducing RISR, improving pain, itching and quality of life in this patient group. One group will receive Moogoo Udder Cream¬Æ. Another group will receive aqueous cream. Outcome measures will be collected using patient self-administered questionnaire, interviewer administered questionnaire and clinician assessment at commencement of radiotherapy, weekly during radiotherapy, and four weeks after the completion of radiotherapy. DISCUSSION: Despite advances of radiologic advances and supportive care, RISR are still not well managed. There is a lack of efficacious interventions in managing RISR. While anecdotal evidence suggests that Moogoo Udder Cream¬Æ may be effective in managing RISR, research is needed to substantiate this claim. This paper presents the design of a double blind randomised controlled trial that will evaluate the effects of Moogoo Udder Cream¬Æ versus aqueous cream for managing in RISR in patients with cancer.

Crystal and molecular structure of the prepared BTG were identified using X-ray crystallography. In vitro study revealed BTG more cytotoxic than BTG‚Äâ+‚ÄâZnO-NPs on human breast cancer (MCF-7) cell line. In vivo study demonstrated that the blood antioxidant status of tumor-bearing rats (DMBA group) was significantly lower than normal noticeable by a significant decrease in GSH content, GPx, SOD, and CAT activities associated with a significantly high MDA content. Both treatments have significantly elevated SOD and CAT activities with a concomitant decrease of MDA level compared to DMBA group. However, BTG‚Äâ+‚ÄâZnO-NPs accentuated the decrease of GSH regarding DMBA group. The results showed also that both treatments significantly activate caspase-3 enzyme and apoptosis in mammary glands. Their administration to tumor-bearing rats was found to significantly reduce plasma iron and iron-binding capacity (TIBC) compared to DMBA group. Regarding liver function, both treatments significantly reduced the increase of ALT and AST activities compared to DMBA group. However, BTG‚Äâ+‚ÄâZnO-NPs decreased albumin below normal level. Histopathological studies showed that normalization of tissue structures was higher in BTG than BTG‚Äâ+‚ÄâZnO-NPs treatment. According to the results obtained, it is observed that the antitumor effect of BTG alone was as strong as BTG‚Äâ+‚ÄâZnO-NPs and even more efficient in some aspects accordingly, a combination is not needed.

25666502,Low Concentration of Caffeine Inhibits the Progression of the Hepatocellular Carcinoma via Akt Signaling Pathway.,"Accumulating evidences have reported that caffeine has anticancer effects at high blood concentrations. However, whether caffeine has anticancer effects on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells at low concentration, especially at physiologically applicable concentration (< 412 ŒºM) is still not well understood. In this study, HCC cell lines HepG2 and Huh7 were used. The cells were incubated with varying concentrations of caffeine (0, 50, 100, 200, 400 or 600 ŒºM). MTT assay was used to investigate the proliferation ability in vitro. Migration and invasion abilities were determined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. The molecular changes were detected by western blot. An ectopic nude mice model which the mice were gavaged with caffeine was used to reveal the anticancer effects of caffeine on HepG2 cells in vivo. Results showed that caffeine could inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion significantly at physiologically applicable concentration in vitro. Also the associated molecular changes of cancer progression were observed. In animal experiment, the mice gavaged with caffeine also performanced reduced tumor burden in vivo. Moreover, the interrelated protein expression was also observed in vivo which was coincident with the results in vitro. All in all, this observation indicated that caffeine may suppress the progression of HCC through Akt signaling pathway. This makes caffeine a potential candidate for treating HCC which will be a safer and more effective treatment by giving for a long time at physiologically applicable concentration.",include

It enhances detrusor muscle contraction, resulting in higher maximum flow rate, higher detrusor pressure at maximum flow, and lower PVR. The efficacy of this agent in patients after radical hysterectomy is unclear. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of bethanechol chloride compared with placebo for the prevention of bladder dysfunction after type III radical hysterectomy. METHODS: Gynecologic cancer patients who underwent type III radical hysterectomy were randomized by computer-generated schedule to assign patients in a 1:1 ratio into 2 groups. The treatment group received bethanechol chloride (Ucholine 20 mg 3 times a day on the third to seventh postoperative day), and the control group received placebo. Patients and physicians were masked to treatment allocation. The primary end point was the rate of urethral catheter removal at 1 week postoperatively. If PVR was more than 30% of voided volume, the urethral catheter was reinserted, and medication would be continued but not for more than 1 month. This study was registered as ISRCTN92687416. FINDINGS: There were 31 patients in each group without significant difference in baseline characteristics. Twenty-one patients (67.7%) in the treatment group and 12 patients (38.7%) in the control group had the urethral catheter removed at 1 week postoperatively (P = 0.04). Median duration of urethral catheterization was shorter in the treatment group (7 and 14 days, P = 0.03). However, the PVR and the incidence of urinary tract infection at 1 month postoperatively were not significantly different. Nine patients (29%) in the treatment group had adverse events such as nausea, abdominal distension, and abdominal cramping, which was higher than the control group (1 patient, 3.2%; P = 0.01). However, no patients required any medical treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Bethanechol chloride decreases the duration of urethral catheterization in patients who underwent type III radical hysterectomy with manageable adverse events.",exclude
23382637,Pilot study on efficacy of reduced cathartic bowel preparation with polyethylene glycol and bisacodyl.,"AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of reduced cathartic bowel preparation with 2 L polyethylene glycol (PEG)-4000 electrolyte solution and 10 mg bisacodyl enteric-coated tablets for computed tomographic colonography (CTC). METHODS: Sixty subjects who gave informed consent were randomly assigned to study group A, study group B or the control group. On the day prior to CTC, subjects in study group A were given 20 mL 40% wt/vol barium sulfate suspension before 3 mealtimes, 60 mL 60% diatrizoate meglumine diluted in 250 mL water after supper, and 10 mg bisacodyl enteric-coated tablets 1 h before oral administration of 2 L PEG-4000 electrolyte solution. Subjects in study group B were treated identically to those in study group A, with the exception of bisacodyl which was given 1 h after oral PEG-4000. Subjects in the control group were managed using the same strategy as the subjects in study group A, but without administration of bisacodyl. Residual stool and fluid scores, the attenuation value of residual fluid, and discomfort during bowel preparation in the three groups were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The mean scores for residual stool and fluid in study group A were lower than those in study group B, but the differences were not statistically significant. Subjects in study group A showed greater stool and fluid cleansing ability than the subjects in study group B. The mean scores for residual stool and fluid in study groups A and B were lower than those in the control group, and were significantly different. There was no significant difference in the mean attenuation value of residual fluid between study group A, study group B and the control group. The total discomfort index during bowel preparation was 46, 45 and 45 in the three groups, respectively, with no significant difference. CONCLUSION: Administration of 10 mg bisacodyl enteric-coated tablets prior to or after oral administration of 2 L PEG-4000 electrolyte solution enhances stool and fluid cleansing ability, and has no impact on the attenuation value of residual fluid or the discomfort index. The former is an excellent alternative for CTC colorectum cleansing.",exclude
25060683,"The efficacy of topical bupivacaine and triamcinolone acetonide injection in the relief of pain after endoscopic submucosal dissection for gastric neoplasia: a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Although pain is a common complication of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), management strategies are inadequate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of topical bupivacaine and triamcinolone acetonide for abdominal pain relief and as a potential method of pain control after ESD for gastric neoplasia. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 111 eligible patients with early gastric neoplasm were randomized into one of three groups: bupivacaine (BV) only, bupivacaine with triamcinolone (BV-TA), or placebo. The present pain intensity (PPI) score and the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) were used to evaluate pain at 0, 6, 12, and 24 h after ESD. RESULTS: The mean values for the 6-hour PPI in the BV-TA and BV groups were lower than those of the placebo group (1.57 ¬± 1.09 and 1.97 ¬± 1.09 vs. 2.63 ¬± 0.98, p < 0.001). The 12-hour PPI of the BV-TA group (1.20 ¬± 0.83) was the lowest among the three groups (p = 0.001). The total 6-hour SF-MPQ score, especially in the sensory domain, was higher in the placebo group than in BV and BV-TA groups. The 12-hour SF-MPQ score was the lowest in the BV-TA group. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that BV-TA injection protocol, fibrosis, and size of residual ulcer were independently associated with the PPI score at 6 h. CONCLUSION: Bupivacaine after ESD was effective for pain relief at 6 h postoperatively. Particularly, topical infiltration of bupivacaine mixed with triamcinolone acetonide was helpful for producing a more long-lasting benefit of pain relief after gastric ESD.",exclude

We aimed to explore the effect of adding morphine to bupivacaine in ultrasound guided TAP-block in patients undergoing lower abdominal cancer surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, prospective study. Clinical trial identifier: NCT02566096. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: Sixty patients were enrolled in this study after ethical committee approval. INTERVENTIONS: Patients divided into 2 groups (30 each): Bupivacaine group (GB): given ultrasound guided TAP-block 20ml 0.5% bupivacaine diluted in 20ml saline; Morphine group (GM): given ultrasound guided TAP-block with 20ml 0.5% bupivacaine+10mg morphine sulphate diluted in 20ml saline. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were observed for total morphine consumption, time for first request of rescue analgesia, sedation scores, hemodynamics and side effects for 24h postoperatively. RESULTS: Morphine added to bupivacaine in TAP block compared to bupivacaine alone reduced total morphine consumption (5.33¬±1.28mg) (10.70¬±3.09mg) respectively (p<0.001), prolonged the time to first request of analgesia (10.40¬±4.96h) (6.97¬±3.26h) respectively (p<0.008), with a statistically significant decrease in (VAS-M) in GM compared with GB at 12h postoperatively (p<0.002). No significant differences in hemodynamics, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, sedation score, and side effects except for nausea were observed (p>0.05).

28520955,"Effect of Intrathecally Administered Ketamine, Morphine, and Their Combination Added to Bupivacaine in Patients Undergoing Major Abdominal Cancer Surgery a Randomized, Double-Blind Study.","Objective: Effective postoperative pain control reduces postoperative morbidity. In this study, we investigated the effects of intrathecal morphine, ketamine, and their combination with bupivacaine for postoperative analgesia in major abdominal cancer surgery. Study Design: Prospective, randomized, double-blind. Setting: Academic medical center. Patients and Methods: Ninety ASA I-III patients age 30 to 50‚Äâyears were divided randomly into three groups: the morphine group (group M) received 10‚Äâmg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in 2‚ÄâmL volume and 0.3‚Äâmg morphine in 1‚ÄâmL volume intrathecally. The ketamine group (group K) received 0.1‚Äâmg/kg ketamine in 1‚ÄâmL volume instead of morphine. The morphine‚Äâ+‚Äâketamine group (group K‚Äâ+‚ÄâM) received both 0.3‚Äâmg morphine and 0.1‚Äâmg/kg ketamine in 1‚ÄâmL volume intrathecally. Postoperative total morphine consumption, first request of analgesia, visual analog score (VAS), and side effects were recorded. Results: Total PCA morphine was significantly decreased in group M‚Äâ+‚ÄâK compared with groups M and K. Time to first request of analgesia was prolonged in groups M and M‚Äâ+‚ÄâK compared with group K (P < 0.001).

Conclusions: Adding intrathecal ketamine 0.1‚Äâmg/kg to morphine 0.3‚Äâmg in patients who underwent major abdominal cancer surgery reduced the total postoperative morphine consumption in comparison with either drug alone, with an overall good postoperative analgesia in all groups, with no side effects apart from sedation.",exclude
28860712,A comparison of oral controlled-release morphine and oxycodone with transdermal formulations of buprenorphine and fentanyl in the treatment of severe pain in cancer patients.,"AIM OF THE STUDY: To compare analgesia and adverse effects during oral morphine and oxycodone and transdermal fentanyl and buprenorphine administration in cancer patients with pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer patients treated at home and in outpatient clinics with severe pain (numerical rating scale score 6-10) fail to respond to non-opioids and/or weak opioids. All patients were randomized to either morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl or buprenorphine and divided into subgroups with predominant neuropathic and nociceptive pain component. Doses of opioids were titrated to satisfactory analgesia and acceptable adverse effects intensity. Patients were assessed at baseline and followed for 28 days. In all patient groups, immediate-release oral morphine was the rescue analgesic and lactulose 10 mL twice daily was the prophylaxis of constipation; no antiemetics were used as prophylaxis. RESULTS: A total of 62 patients participated and 53 patients completed the study. Good analgesia was obtained for all 4 opioids, for both nociceptive and neuropathic pain. The use of co-analgesics was greater in patients with neuropathic pain. Morphine treatment was associated with less negative impact of pain on ability to walk, work and activity (trend) according to Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form scores and less consumption of rescue morphine. The most common adverse effects included nausea and drowsiness, which increased at the beginning of the treatment and gradually decreased over the days to come. Appetite, well-being, anxiety, depression, and fatigue improved. There was no constipation (the Bowel Function Index scores were within normal range) during the treatment with all opioids. No changes were seen for constipation, vomiting and dyspnea. CONCLUSION: All opioids were effective and well-tolerated. Morphine was the most effective in the improvement in some of the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form items regarding negative impact of pain on patients' daily activities. Prophylaxis of constipation was effective; antiemetics may be considered for nausea prevention.",exclude
18411010,"Efficacy and safety of transdermal buprenorphine: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 289 patients with severe cancer pain.","Strong opioids are recommended for treating severe cancer pain in the advanced stages of the disease. Few data are available concerning the efficacy of buprenorphine in cancer pain. We compared transdermal buprenorphine 70 microg/h (BUP TDS) to placebo in an enriched design study. Opioid-tolerant patients with cancer pain requiring strong opioids in the dose range of 90-150 mg/d oral morphine equivalents entered a two-week run-in phase, during which they were converted to BUP TDS. Patients who could be stabilized on BUP TDS were randomized to BUP TDS or placebo patch for a two-week maintenance phase. Rescue medication (buprenorphine sublingual tablets 0.2mg) was allowed as required. Response was defined as a mean pain intensity of <5 (0-10 scale) and a mean daily buprenorphine sublingual tablet intake of < or =2 tablets during the maintenance phase. Of 289 patients who entered the run-in phase, 100 discontinued treatment due to lack of efficacy or adverse events; 189 patients continued treatment in the maintenance phase (94 BUP TDS, 95 placebo), of whom 31 discontinued treatment (7 BUP TDS, 24 placebo). A significant difference in the number of treatment responders was observed: 70 BUP TDS (74.5%, 65.7-83.3) vs. 47 placebo (50%, 39.9-60.1) (P=0.0003). This result was supported by a lower daily pain intensity, lower intake of buprenorphine sublingual tablets and fewer dropouts in the BUP TDS group. The incidence of adverse events was slightly higher for BUP TDS. In conclusion, BUP TDS 70 microg/h is an efficacious and safe treatment for patients with severe cancer pain.",exclude
23320402,A feasibility study of transdermal buprenorphine versus transdermal fentanyl in the long-term management of persistent non-cancer pain.,"OBJECTIVE: Buprenorphine and fentanyl transdermal patches are used widely for the management of persistent malignant and nonmalignant pain. Buprenorphine and fentanyl transdermal patches, both potent opioids, are considered to be equally efficacious in managing persistent pain. Various retrospective studies comparing dosage changes of buprenorphine and fentanyl patches in persistent pain patients have been completed; however, no long-term prospective, randomized, clinical study has compared the effectiveness of these patches. The objective of the present study was to satisfy this need. AIMS: This study aims to compare prospectively the long-term efficacy, acceptability, and side effects of both of these patches in patients with persistent pain. This study would examine the feasibility and lay the groundwork for a larger, multicenter study where such efficacy and safety outcomes of the two medications can be adequately assessed. DESIGN: The participants were 46 adults (range 22-80 years.) with nonmalignant persistent pain (mean‚Äâ=‚Äâ11 years), predominantly with lower back pain. Data were obtained monthly for 12 months. Participants recruited were opioid-na√Øve patients, having pain for the greater part of the day and night, and appropriate for treatment with transdermal patches. After initial assessment, participants were randomly allocated to either buprenorphine or fentanyl patch treatment. Participants were then titrated to optimal doses of medication. Patients with adverse effects or unsatisfactory pain relief were treated alternatively and discontinued from the study. RESULTS: Nearly one-third of all patients, 41% (8 of 22) of the transdermal buprenorphine (TDB) group and 37.5% (8 of 24) of the transdermal fentanyl (TDF) group stopped treatment due to unacceptable side effects or inadequate pain relief. The remaining participants showed a similar trend in the improvement of pain intensity, physical activity, sleep, and mood throughout the study. Significant relief in the intensity of pain was achieved for the initial 6 months and the effects stabilized in the remainder of the study in both groups. There were no significant group differences over time. However, a higher equipotent dose of fentanyl was required for comparable pain relief. Compared with TDF group, the TDB group initially experienced relatively less side effects. However, a greater number of buprenorphine users suffered from local skin reactions. Buprenorphine users had significant improvement in mood. Thirty-one percent (5 of 16) of the buprenorphine group and 57% (8 of 14) of the fentanyl users needed additional pain relief medications by the end of 3 months. By the end of 12 months, a significant number 78% (7 of 9) of buprenorphine users but comparatively fewer 44% (4 of 9) of the fentanyl group used rescue medicines. Both had more doctor visits in the latter half of the study. CONCLUSION: Thirty percent of the total number of patients discontinued treatment because of side effects or unsatisfactory pain relief. For those continuing treatment, clinical improvements were seen in the initial 6 months in both groups. Fifty percent of the TDB and 43% of TDF groups had significant relief in 3 months, which persisted up to 6 months. Only 11% and 13% of patients, respectively, had sustained relief after 6 months. Twenty percent more patients in the TDB group benefited significantly in symptoms of depression from TDB compared with the TDF group. Interestingly, switching of patches seemed to increase acceptability by preventing adverse effects and tolerance. Confirmation of these effects should be studied in future with a multicenter study and larger sample.",exclude

Eighty patients (age 27-70 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II) undergoing laparoscopic resection of a gastrointestinal tumor were randomized into 4 groups and offered intravenous patient-controlled analgesia for pain control after surgery. The patients received sufentanil 2.0‚ÄäŒºg/kg in combination with dexmedetomidine 1.5‚ÄäŒºg/kg (group S1) or 2.0‚ÄäŒºg/kg (group S2), or butorphanol 0.15‚Äämg/kg in combination with dexmedetomidine 1.5 0‚ÄäŒºg/kg (group N1) or 2.0‚ÄäŒºg/kg (group N2). Oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, visual analog scale score, and Ramsay sedation score were recorded at enrollment (T0), at extubation (T1), and 4 (T2), 8 (T3), 12 (T4), 24 (T5), and 48 (T6) hours thereafter. Side effects and satisfaction scores were evaluated after surgery.MAP increased in all groups at T1 but not significantly so when compared with T0. Heart rate decreased significantly in group S2 when compared with the other groups at T1-T5 (P‚Ää<‚Ää0.05). MAP decreased significantly in group S2 when compared with group S1 at T4-T6 (P‚Ää<‚Ää0.05). MAP increased significantly in group N1 when compared with group N2 at T4-T5 (P‚Ää<‚Ää0.05). There was a statistically significant decrease in mean visual analog scale score in group S2 when compared with group S1 at T2 (P‚Ää<‚Ää0.05) and group N2 at T1-T2 (P‚Ää<‚Ää0.05). Two patients in group S1 had vomiting. There were no reports of drowsiness, respiratory depression, or other complications. The satisfaction score was higher in group S2 than in the other groups.Dexmedetomidine in combination with sufentanil or butorphanol can be used safely and effectively for postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing laparoscopic resection of a gastrointestinal tumor.

27217761,Effect of ketamine combined with butorphanol on emergence agitation of postoperative patients with gastric cancer.,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the effect of ketamine combined with butorphanol on emergence agitation (EA) in postoperative gastric cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 150 patients with gastric cancer were included and divided into group B (1 mg butorphanol before anesthesia induction, n=50), group K (1 mg/kg ketamine, n=50), and group C (1 mg butorphanol combined with 1 mg/kg ketamine, n=50). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) at the end of operation, just before extubation (T0) and at 0 minute (T1), 5 minutes (T2), and 30 minutes (T3) after extubation were compared. Statistical analysis of recovery time, extubation time, time in postanesthesia care unit, and EA incidence and adverse reactions were performed. RESULTS: There were no differences among groups with respect to MAP and HR at T0 and T1 (P>0.05). Compared with patients in group C, significant reduction of MAP and HR were observed in groups K and B at T2 and T3 (P<0.05), while no differences were found between group K and group B (P>0.05). Recovery time, extubation time, time in postanesthesia care unit, and incidence of EA in group C were significantly less than those in groups K and B (P<0.05), but no differences were observed between group K and group B (P>0.05). Total incidence of adverse reactions were significantly increased in group K compared to those in groups C and B (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Injection of ketamine combined with butorphanol before anesthesia induction was more effective than injection of ketamine or butorphanol separately in the prevention of EA.",exclude
10870071,Oral administration of cefixime to lower risk febrile neutropenic children with cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Febrile neutropenia is a heterogeneous condition. Recently, several risk factors have been defined, permitting the definition of a lower risk group of patients who may benefit form less aggressive therapy. The use of an oral antibiotic approach was tested in the current trial. METHODS: From May 1997 to March 1998, 154 episodes of lower risk febrile neutropenia in 128 children with a mean age of 62 (range, 8-200) months were enrolled in this randomized, single-institution trial. Inclusion criteria were fever (> 38 degrees C), neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm(3)), lower risk features (i.e., absence of severe comorbidity factors, good clinical condition, negative blood cultures, control of local infection, no fever during the last 24 hours), and compliance of parents. After 3 days of ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg/day administered intravenously [i.v.]) every 12 hours plus amikacin (15 mg/kg/day i.v.) every 24 hours for 3 days, all patients were discharged and randomized to be allocated to 2 treatment arms. Group A (n = 74) received ceftriaxone cefixime (8 mg/kg/day administered orally) every 24 hours for 4 days, whereas Group B (n = 80) was treated with ceftriaxone plus amikacin for 7 days. Failure was defined as the need for second hospitalization during the same episode of neutropenia, or fever during the 7 days after discharge. RESULTS: Most of the patients (49% in Group A and 55% in Group B) had acute leukemia. Fifty-four (72%) children in Group A and 46 (56%) in Group B had fever of unknown origin (P = not significant [NS]). No significant differences were found in the sites of initial infection between the two groups. Overall results were outstanding, with a favorable outcome in 73 of 78 cases (98.6%) in Group A and 78 of 80 cases (97.5%) in Group B (P = NS). Three patients needed a second hospitalization due to failure of the initial therapy: one in Group A and two in Group B. All three did well with secondary treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In lower risk febrile neutropenic children receiving anticancer therapy, the efficacy of oral cefixime, given for 4 days after 72 hours of intravenous ceftriaxone plus amikacin, was similar to that of 7 days of parenteral ceftriaxone plus amikacin. The oral outpatient therapy approach to the treatment of lower risk febrile neutropenia after chemotherapy is safe and may be cost-saving. This strategy might be adopted as standard therapy in the future.",exclude
17225113,Early hospital discharge with oral antimicrobial therapy in patients with hematologic malignancies and low-risk febrile neutropenia.,"Although consensus exists relating criteria for the identification of low-risk patients with febrile neutropenia, no clear indication on how to manage these patients has been so far provided particularly in outpatients affected by hematologic malignancies. The feasibility and safety of early discharge was prospectively evaluated in 100 outpatients with hematologic malignancies and febrile neutropenia. A strategy considering the risk-index of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) was applied. High-risk patients were entirely managed at hospital. Low-risk patients were early discharged if they were afebrile since 48 h and not on supportive therapy requiring hospitalization. Out of 90 low-risk episodes, in 69 instances (76.7%), patients were discharged after a median of 4 days and continued home therapy with oral cefixime (78%) or other antibiotics. Only five outpatients (7.2%) had fever recurrence. Twenty-one low-risk patients were not early discharged due to worsening conditions (three deaths), need of multiple daily dose therapy, or discharge refuse. No clinical characteristic was able to predict the eligibility for early discharge. The MASCC risk-index is a useful aid in the identification of high-risk febrile neutropenia needing whole in-hospital treatment. As for low-risk patients, hospitalization at least in the first days of fever is required. Cefixime could be included among the oral antibacterial drugs to be used in the outpatient treatment of adult patients with febrile neutropenia.",exclude
26671516,"The clinical management of abdominal ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: a review of current guidelines and recommendations.","Several pathogenic processes have been implicated in the development of abdominal ascites. Portal hypertension, most usually in the context of liver cirrhosis, can explain about 75% of the cases, whereas infective, inflammatory and infiltrative aetiologies can account for the rest. In this article, we discuss the consensus best practice as published by three professional bodies for the management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The aim of this study was to compare available clinical guidelines and identify areas of agreement and conflict. We carried out a review of the guidance documentation published by three expert bodies including the British Society of Gastroenterology, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), as well as a wider literature search for ascites, SBP and HRS. Abdominal ultrasonography, diagnostic paracentesis and ascitic fluid cultures are recommended by all three guidelines, especially when there is strong clinical suspicion for infection. EASL and AASLD advocate the use of ascitic amylase and mycobacterial cultures/PCR when there is strong suspicion for tuberculosis and pancreatitis, respectively. Ascitic cytology can be useful when cancer is suspected and has a good diagnostic yield if performed correctly. EASL supports the use of urinary electrolytes for all patients; however, the British Society of Gastroenterology and AASLD only recommend their use for therapy monitoring. All three societies recommend cefotaxime as the antibiotic of choice for SBP and large-volume paracentesis for the management of ascites greater than 5‚Äâl in volume. For HRS, cautious diuresis, volume expansion with albumin and the use of vasoactive drugs are recommended. There appears to be good concordance between recommendations by the European, American and British guidelines for the management of ascites and the possible complications arising from it.",exclude
28027282,Role of Rifampin in Reducing Inflammation and Neuronal Damage in Childhood Bacterial Meningitis: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of acute bacterial meningitis in children with bactericidal antibiotics causes cell wall lysis and a surge in inflammatory cascade, which in turn contributes to neuronal damage and morbidity. Pretreatment with a nonbacteriolytic antibiotic, such as rifampin, has been shown to attenuate the inflammatory response in experimental models of bacterial meningitis. In a pilot study, in children with bacterial meningitis, we have studied markers of inflammatory response and neuronal damage in 2 groups of children with bacterial meningitis; one group received rifampin pretreatment with ceftriaxone and the other group received ceftriaxone alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty children with bacterial meningitis, who were 3 months to 12 years of age, were randomly assigned to receive either a single dose rifampin (20 mg/kg) 30 minutes before ceftriaxone or ceftriaxone alone was given. The primary outcome variables were cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFŒ±), S100B and neuron-specific enolase on day 1 and day 5, and secondary outcome variables were the values of TNFŒ± and interleukin 6 in serum on day 1 and day 5; hearing and neurologic sequelae at 3 months after recovery from the illness. RESULTS: Children in rifampin pretreatment group had significantly lower CSF TNFŒ± concentrations [median (interquartile range [IQR]): 15.5 (7.2-22.0) vs. 53.0 (9.0-87.5) pg/mL, P = 0.019] and S100B [median (IQR): 145.0 (54.7-450.0) vs. 447.5 (221.0-804.6) pg/mL, P = 0.033] on day 1 and S100B [median (IQR): 109.7 (64.0-287.0) vs. 322 (106.7-578.0) pg/mL, P = 0.048] and neuron-specific enolase [median (IQR): 8.6 (5-14.75) vs. 18.2 (7.0-28.75) ng/mL, P = 0.035] on day 5 when compared with ceftriaxone alone group. The rifampin-treated group also had reduced morbidity and neurologic sequelae; however, these were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with single dose rifampin 30 minutes before ceftriaxone administration reduced the CSF concentrations of markers of inflammation and neuronal damage in children with bacterial meningitis.",exclude

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Subjects were randomly assigned to receive cevimeline, 30 mg three times daily, or placebo for 12 weeks, with the possibility of dose escalation to 45 mg three times daily at 6 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the patient's final global evaluation of oral dryness; change in unstimulated salivary flow was a secondary endpoint. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy subjects (284 in Study 003 and 286 in Study 004) were randomized. Significantly more cevimeline-treated subjects than placebo recipients (47.4% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.0162) in Study 003 reported improvement in dry mouth in the final global evaluation of oral dryness. No significant difference between groups in the final global evaluation was seen in Study 004, in which a high placebo response rate of 47.6% was observed. In both studies, cevimeline-treated subjects had significantly greater increases in the objective measure of unstimulated salivary flow than placebo recipients (p = 0.0093 [Study 003] and p = 0.0215 [Study 004]), whereas no significant differences in stimulated salivary flow were observed. The most frequent adverse event was increased sweating. CONCLUSION: Cevimeline was well tolerated by patients with xerostomia after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, and oral administration of 30-45 mg of cevimeline three times daily increased unstimulated salivary flow.",exclude

We hypothesized that oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal decontamination with chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) would be an effective method to reduce these complications as reported in cardiac surgery. METHODS: In this multicenter parallel-group randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled consecutive adults scheduled for anatomical pulmonary resection for lung cancer. Perioperative decontamination consisted in oropharyngeal rinse solution (0.12% CHG) and nasopharyngeal soap (4% CHG) or a placebo. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients requiring postoperative¬†invasive and/or noninvasive mechanical ventilation (MV). Secondary outcome measures included occurrence of respiratory and non-respiratory healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and outcomes within 90 days. RESULTS: Between July 2012 and April 2015, 474 patients were randomized. Of them, 24 had their surgical procedure cancelled or withdrew consent. The remaining 450 patients were included in a modified intention-to-treat analysis: 226 were allocated to CHG and 224 to the placebo. Proportions of patients requiring postoperative MV were not significantly different [CHG 14.2%; placebo 15.2%; relative risks (RRs) 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59-1.45; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.76]. Neither of the proportions of patients with respiratory HAIs were different (CHG 13.7%; placebo 12.9%; RRs 1.06; 95% CI 0.66-1.69; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.81). The CHG group had significantly decreased incidence of bacteremia, surgical-site infection and overall Staphylococcus aureus infections. However, there were no significant between-group differences for hospital stay length, change in tracheal microbiota, postoperative antibiotic utilization and outcomes by day 90. CONCLUSIONS: CHG decontamination decreased neither MV requirements nor respiratory infections after lung cancer surgery. Additionally, CHG did not change tracheal microbiota or postoperative antibiotic utilization. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01613365.",exclude
12231542,Mebendazole elicits a potent antitumor effect on human cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo.,"We have found that mebendazole (MZ), a derivative of benzimidazole, induces a dose- and time-dependent apoptotic response in human lung cancer cell lines. In this study, MZ arrested cells at the G(2)-M phase before the onset of apoptosis, as detected by using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. MZ treatment also resulted in mitochondrial cytochrome c release, followed by apoptotic cell death. Additionally, MZ appeared to be a potent inhibitor of tumor cell growth with little toxicity to normal WI38 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. When administered p.o. to nu/nu mice, MZ strongly inhibited the growth of human tumor xenografts and significantly reduced the number and size of tumors in an experimental model of lung metastasis. In assessing angiogenesis, we found significantly reduced vessel densities in MZ-treated mice compared with those in control mice. These results suggest that MZ is effective in the treatment of cancer and other angiogenesis-dependent diseases.",include
14871995,Phenylbutyrate and phenylacetate induce differentiation and inhibit proliferation of human medulloblastoma cells.,"PURPOSE: Phenylbutyrate (PB) and phenylacetate (PA) have antiproliferative and differentiation-inducing effects in malignant tumors, and had been evaluated in Phase I/II clinical trials. This study was undertaken to evaluate their antitumor activities in medulloblastomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The biological effects of PB and PA, ranging from 0.1 mM to 3 mM, on two medulloblastoma cell lines (DAOY and D283-MED) were examined using various long-term in vitro and in vivo assays for morphology, proliferation, differentiation, anchorage-independent growth, apoptosis, and tumorigenicity. RESULTS: PB and PA can both induce morphological changes and suppress proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. These effects were more pronounced with PB and became irreversible in D283-MED cells after continuous exposure to 3 mM PB for 28 days. Both PB and PA were able to increase expression of glial marker glial fibriliary acidic protein and neuronal marker synaptophysin in two cell lines. For anchorage-independent growth, PB showed a more significant suppression than PA in D283-MED cells. PB caused more pronounced cell cycle arrest and remarkably reduced tumorigenicity in D283-MED cells than in DAOY cells. Apoptosis was readily induced in D283-MED cells with either low dose of PB or short-term treatment. In contrast, much higher concentrations of PB or longer treatment were required to achieve similar effect with DAOY cells. PB induced increased histones H3 acetylation in both cell lines, but histone H4 acetylation was only observed in D283-MED cells. CONCLUSIONS: PB, through induction of hyperacetylation of histone H3 and H4, is a much more potent antitumor agent than PA. 283-MED cells are more responsive to PB than DAOY cells, which may be dependent on their original state of differentiation as well as the changes of histone H4 acetylation status.",include
21374736,Chemoprevention of lung carcinogenesis by the combination of aerosolized budesonide and oral pioglitazone in A/J mice.,"Budesonide, a synthetic glucocorticoid used for treating asthma, and pioglitazone, a synthetic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors Œ≥ ligand used for the treatment of diabetes, were evaluated for their combinational chemopreventive efficacy on mouse lung cancer using female A/J mice with benzo(a)pyrene used as the carcinogen. All chemopreventive treatments began 2-wk post-carcinogen treatment and continued daily for 20 wk. Budesonide was administered by the aerosol route using an improved aerosol delivery system. Pioglitazone was introduced by oral gavage. The characterization of drug distribution showed that budesonide introduced by aerosol delivery accumulated only in the lung. Budesonide alone reduced tumor load by 78% and pioglitazone alone reduced tumor load by 63%. By combining aerosolized budesonide with pioglitazone, the inhibition on tumor load was 90%. In vitro experiments using human cancer cells showed that budesonide and pioglitazone exhibited independent, additive inhibitory effects on cell growth. Our results provide evidence that aerosolized budesonide and oral pioglitazone could be a promising drug combination for lung cancer chemoprevention.",include
25446664,Metformin inhibits ovarian cancer growth and increases sensitivity to paclitaxel in mouse models.,"OBJECTIVE: There is increasing preclinical evidence indicating that metformin, a medication commonly used for type 2 diabetes mellitus, may protect against cancer. Motivated by this emerging evidence we asked 2 questions: (1) can metformin prevent ovarian cancer growth by altering metabolism and (2) will metformin increase sensitivity to chemotherapy. STUDY DESIGN: The effect of metformin in ovarian cancer was tested in¬†vitro and with 2 different mouse models. In¬†vitro, cell lines (n¬†= 6) were treated with metformin (10-40 mmol/L) or phosphate-buffered saline solution and cellular proliferation and metabolic alterations (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activity, glycolysis, and lipid synthesis) were compared between the 2 groups. In mouse models, a prevention study was performed by treating mice with metformin (250¬†mg/kg/d intraperitoneally) or placebo for 2 weeks followed by intraperitoneal injection of the SKOV3ip1 human ovarian cancer cell line, and the mean number of tumor implants in each treatment group was compared. In a treatment study, the LSL-K-ras(G12D/+)/PTEN(floxP/floxP) genetic mouse model of ovarian cancer was used. Mice were treated with placebo, paclitaxel (3 mg/kg/wk intraperitoneally for 7 weeks), metformin (100 mg/kg/d in water for 7 weeks), or paclitaxel plus metformin, and tumor volume was compared among treatment groups. RESULTS: In¬†vitro, metformin decreased proliferation of ovarian cancer cell lines and induced cell cycle arrest, but not apoptosis. Further analysis showed that metformin altered several aspects of metabolism including adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activity, glycolysis, and lipid synthesis. In the prevention mouse model, mice that were pretreated with metformin had 60% fewer tumor implants compared with controls (P < .005). In the treatment study, mice that were treated with paclitaxel plus metformin had a 60% reduction in tumor weight compared with controls (P¬†= .02), which is a level of tumor reduction greater than that resulting from either paclitaxel or metformin alone. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, we conclude that metformin¬†alters metabolism in ovarian cancer cells, prevents tumor growth, and increases sensitivity to chemotherapy in¬†vitro and in mouse models. These preclinical findings suggest that metformin warrants further investigation for use as an ovarian cancer therapeutic.",include
28239823,Inhibitory effect and mechanism of metformin on human ovarian cancer cells SKOV-3 and A2780.,"OBJECTIVE: Ovarian cancer is the most common malignant tumor in female reproductive system. Metformin is an orally taken hypoglycemic agent, which is extensively applied in the clinic. Clinical trials find that there may be a certain degree of action of the metformin in inhibiting malignant tumors. This paper aims to investigate the inhibitory effect and mechanism of metformin on human ovarian cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through in vitro cell experiment, the influences of metformin on the proliferation, colony formation and apoptosis of ovarian carcinoma cells were studied. Ovarian cancer cells SKOV-3 and A2780 in logarithmic growth phase were selected and cell proliferation was measured by MTT method. The metformin was processed for 48 h to calculate the survival rate of cells. Also, metformin was processed for 24 h and two weeks or stained with crystal violet, after which Quantity One (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) method was used to quantitatively analyze the cell clone formation, meanwhile, the FCM (flow cytometry) was used for the detection and analysis. RESULTS: Intervened by metformin with different concentrations for 48 h, the cell viabilities of SKOV-3 and A2780 cells were respectively reduced by 19.49 ¬± 2.92%, 45.41 ¬± 7.95%, 53.84 ¬± 5.53%, 64.04 ¬± 4.36% and 11.45 ¬± 3.12%, 35.42 ¬± 7.55%, 43.77 ¬± 5.77%, 53.05 ¬± 5.55% as compared with that in the control group with statistical significances. After processed by metformin with different concentrations for two weeks, the cells clone numbers of SKOV-3 and A2780 were significantly reduced. Treatment of metformin on SKOV-3 and A2780 cells of human ovarian cancer showed significant apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The metformin has the inhibitory effect on the cells of human ovarian cancer, which may be through inducing ovarian cancer cell apoptosis.",include
23490148,"A novel metformin derivative, HL010183, inhibits proliferation and invasion of triple-negative breast cancer cells.","Mounting evidence suggests that metformin (N,N-dimethylbiguanide), a widely prescribed drug for the treatment of type II diabetes, exerts an anti-tumor effect on several cancers including breast cancer. Breast cancer has been estimated as one of the most commonly diagnosed types of cancer among women. In particular, triple-negative breast cancers are associated with poor prognosis and metastatic growth. In the present study, we synthesized a novel metformin derivative 5 (HL010183) and metformin salts, 9a, 9b, and 9c (metformin gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) salt, metformin pregabalin salt and metformin gabapentin salt), which exerted more potent inhibitory effects on the proliferation and invasiveness of Hs578T triple-negative breast carcinoma cells than metformin. Importantly, 5 showed approximately 100-fold more potent effects compared to metformin. In a triple-negative breast cancer xenograft model, 5 showed a comparable degree of inhibitory effect on in vivo tumor growth at the 100mg/kg dose to that of metformin at 500 mg/kg. Our results clearly demonstrate that 5 exerts a potent anti-tumor effect both in vitro and in vivo, paving the way for a strategy for treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.",include
12376516,Aspirin use in relation to risk of prostate cancer.,"Experimental studies have shown inhibitory effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on prostate cancer cell proliferation and reduction of prostate cancer metastasis, suggesting their possible preventive role for prostate cancer. We examined the association between regular aspirin use and the risk of prostate cancer among participants in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, a prospective cohort of 47,882 United States men who were 40-75 years of age and without a history of prostate cancer in 1986. Biennial self-administered questionnaires were used to assess regular aspirin use from 1986 to 1996. We confirmed and staged incident cases of prostate cancer according to medical records and pathology reports. During 518,072 person-years of follow-up, 2,479 new cases of prostate cancer were ascertained. Of these, 608 were diagnosed as advanced (extraprostatic) prostate cancer and 258 as metastatic prostate cancer. We found no association between aspirin use and total prostate cancer. After accounting for prostate-specific antigen examinations and other potentially confounding variables, the relative risk of total prostate cancer for aspirin users compared with nonusers was 1.05 (95% confidence interval, 0.96-1.14). For metastatic prostate cancer, we observed a suggestive decrease in risk among men reporting greater frequency of aspirin use. The multivariate relative risk of metastatic prostate cancer among men using aspirin 22 or more days/month was 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.39-1.38) compared with nonusers. We noted no evidence of a linear dose-response relationship (P for trend = 0.40). The results from this cohort indicate that regular aspirin use is not likely to prevent the incidence of total prostate cancer, but we cannot exclude a possible benefit of frequent aspirin use on risk of developing metastatic prostate cancer.",exclude
25854386,Aloe vera inhibits proliferation of human breast and cervical cancer cells and acts synergistically with cisplatin.,"Many of the anti-cancer agents currently used have an origin in natural sources including plants. Aloe vera is one such plant being studied extensively for its diverse health benefits, including cancer prevention. In this study, the cytotoxic potential of Aloe vera crude extract (ACE) alone or in combination with cisplatin in human breast (MCF-7) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cells was studied by cell viability assay, nuclear morphological examination and cell cycle analysis. Effects were correlated with modulation of expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and drug metabolism by RT-PCR. Exposure of cells to ACE resulted in considerable loss of cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, which was found to be mediated by through the apoptotic pathway as evidenced by changes in the nuclear morphology and the distribution of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle. Interestingly, ACE did not have any significant cytotoxicity towards normal cells, thus placing it in the category of safe chemopreventive agent. Further, the effects were correlated with the downregulation of cyclin D1, CYP 1A1, CYP 1A2 and increased expression of bax and p21 in MCF-7 and HeLa cells. In addition, low dose combination of ACE and cisplatin showed a combination index less than 1, indicating synergistic growth inhibition compared to the agents applied individually. In conclusion, these results signify that Aloe vera may be an effective anti-neoplastic agent to inhibit cancer cell growth and increase the therapeutic efficacy of conventional drugs like cispolatin. Thus promoting the development of plant-derived therapeutic agents appears warranted for novel cancer treatment strategies. ",include
24090798,"Topical combination of diclofenac, calcipotriol, and difluoromethylornithine has beneficial effects comparable to 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer in mice.","Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common form of skin cancer. Owing to the significant adverse effects of existing treatments, alternatives are needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of topically administered combination therapy and 5-flurouracil (5-FU) for the treatment of UVB induced NMSC in a mouse model. Ninety-six SKH-1 mice were randomized to one placebo group and two treatment groups (diclofenac+calcitriol+difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and 5-FU). After UVB radiation for 20 weeks, the mice with tumours were treated topically for the following 17 weeks. Both treatments significantly reduced the number of tumours, number of mice with tumours as well as tumour area size compared with placebo. As the clinical use of 5-FU may induce more adverse effects, a combination of diclofenac+calcitriol+DFMO could be a promising alternative. Human studies are warranted to determine the beneficial effects and possible adverse effects of this new treatment. ",include
16166455,Celecoxib and curcumin synergistically inhibit the growth of colorectal cancer cells.,"PURPOSE: Multiple studies have indicated that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors may prevent colon cancer, which is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the western world. Recent studies, however, showed that their long-term use may be limited due to cardiovascular toxicity. This study aims to investigate whether curcumin potentiates the growth inhibitory effect of celecoxib, a specific COX-2 inhibitor, in human colon cancer cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: HT-29 and IEC-18-K-ras (expressing high levels of COX-2), Caco-2 (expressing low level of COX-2), and SW-480 (no expression of COX-2) cell lines were exposed to different concentrations of celecoxib (0-50 micromol/L), curcumin (0-20 micromol/L), and their combination. COX-2 activity was assessed by measuring prostaglandin E(2) production by enzyme-linked immunoassay. COX-2 mRNA levels were assessed by reverse transcription-PCR. RESULTS: Exposure to curcumin (10-15 micromol/L) and physiologic doses of celecoxib (5 micromol/L) resulted in a synergistic inhibitory effect on cell growth. Growth inhibition was associated with inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Curcumin augmented celecoxib inhibition of prostaglandin E(2) synthesis. The drugs synergistically down-regulated COX-2 mRNA expression. Western blot analysis showed that the level of COX-1 was not altered by treatment with celecoxib, curcumin, or their combination. CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin potentiates the growth inhibitory effect of celecoxib by shifting the dose-response curve to the left. The synergistic growth inhibitory effect was mediated through a mechanism that probably involves inhibition of the COX-2 pathway and may involve other non-COX-2 pathways. This synergistic effect is clinically important because it can be achieved in the serum of patients receiving standard anti-inflammatory or antineoplastic dosages of celecoxib.",include
19723114,Celecoxib potentiates the anticancer effect of cisplatin on vulvar cancer cells independently of cyclooxygenase.,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been found to be associated with the development and progression of various cancers. Our previous study showed a high expression rate of COX-2 in paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from patients with vulvar cancer. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, as a chemosensitizing agent with cisplatin in vulvar cancer cells A431 and SW962. COX-2 was expressed in both A431 and SW962 vulvar cancer cell lines. COX-1 was expressed in A431 but not in SW962. MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide] assay showed that treatment with 30 micromol/L celecoxib had no effect on cell growth in A431 cells for 72 h. However, combined treatment with celecoxib and cisplatin induced a significant reduction in cell growth compared to single treatment with cisplatin. Interestingly, single treatment with celecoxib or cisplatin and combined treatment of 10 micromol/L celecoxib with 10 micromol/L cisplatin increased COX-2 expression. However, the combination of 30 micromol/L celecoxib and 30 micromol/L cisplatin reduced COX-2 expression to the control state. Inhibition of cell growth by celecoxib alone and in combination with cisplatin was independent of the expression level of COX-2 induced by these agents. While treatment with 10 micromol/L celecoxib or 10 micromol/L piroxicam significantly suppressed the activity of COX enzymes, neither agent affected the growth of A431 and SW962 cells at this concentration. Taken together, celecoxib could be used as a chemosensitizing agent in vulva cancer cells; the anticancer activity of celecoxib seemed to be independent of COX.",include
15816542,Growth inhibitory effect of celecoxib and rofecoxib on human colorectal carcinoma cell lines.,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have revealed a protective effect of NSAIDs, which principally target cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2, on the development of colorectal cancer. Increased expression of COX-2 was shown in colorectal adenocarcinoma. However, some effects were shown to be COX-independent. Here, we compared two selective COX-2 inhibitors for their effect on the growth of colorectal tumour cells in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen tumour cell lines were characterized for COX-1 and COX-2 expression by Western blot and RT-PCR. The effect of celecoxib and rofecoxib on their growth was assessed by staining of DNA with crystal violet. RESULTS: COX-2 expression varied among cell lines, whereas COX-1 was always expressed. Rofecoxib displayed a limited dose-related effect on cell proliferation, whereas celecoxib strongly inhibited cell growth at high concentrations. Both effects appeared COX-2-independent. CONCLUSION: Rofecoxib, which is devoid of apoptotic effect at high concentration but efficient at pharmacological concentrations, revealed a potential new mechanism of action of NSAIDs towards colorectal cancer.",include

Here, we demonstrate the anticancer effects of naproxen against UVB-induced basal cell carcinoma (BCCs) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCCs) in a highly susceptible murine model of UVB carcinogenesis. Naproxen significantly inhibited UVB-induced BCCs and SCCs in this model. Tumor number and volume were significantly decreased (P < 0.005 and P < 0.05, respectively). Inhibition in UVB-induced SCCs and BCCs was 77% and 86%, respectively, which was associated with reduced PCNA and cyclin D1 and increased apoptosis. As expected, inflammation-related iNOS, COX-2 and nuclear NFŒ∫Bp65 were also diminished by naproxen treatment. Residual tumors excised from naproxen-treated animal were less invasive and showed reduced expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snail and Twist with increased expression of E-cadherin. In BCC and SCC cells, naproxen-induced apoptosis and activated unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling with increased expression of ATF4, p-eIF2Œ± and CHOP. Employing iRNA-based approaches, we found that naproxen-induced apoptosis was regulated by CHOP as sensitivity of these cutaneous neoplastic cells for apoptosis was significantly diminished by ablating CHOP. In summary, these data show that naproxen is a potent inhibitor of UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis. ER stress pathway protein CHOP may play an important role in inducing apoptosis in cancer cells.",include
24327721,Naproxen induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in human urinary bladder cancer cell lines and chemically induced cancers by targeting PI3K.,"Naproxen [(S)-6-methoxy-Œ±-methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid] is a potent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 and is widely used as an over-the-counter medication. Naproxen exhibits analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory activities. Naproxen, as well as other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, has been reported to be effective in the prevention of urinary bladder cancer in rodents. However, potential targets other than the COX isozymes have not been reported. We examined potential additional targets in urinary bladder cancer cells and in rat bladder cancers. Computer kinase profiling results suggested that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a potential target for naproxen. In vitro kinase assay data revealed that naproxen interacts with PI3K and inhibits its kinase activity. Pull-down binding assay data confirmed that PI3K directly binds with naproxen in vitro and ex vivo. Western blot data showed that naproxen decreased phosphorylation of Akt, and subsequently decreased Akt signaling in UM-UC-5 and UM-UC-14 urinary bladder cancer cells. Furthermore, naproxen suppressed anchorage-independent cell growth and decreased cell viability by targeting PI3K in both cell lines. Naproxen caused an accumulation of cells at the G1 phase mediated through cyclin-dependent kinase 4, cyclin D1, and p21. Moreover, naproxen induced significant apoptosis, accompanied with increased levels of cleaved caspase-3, caspase-7, and PARP in both cell types. Naproxen-induced cell death was mainly because of apoptosis in which a prominent downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax were involved. Naproxen also caused apoptosis and inhibited Akt phosphorylation in rat urinary bladder cancers induced by N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine.",include

The inhibitory effect of roxithromycin on angiogenesis using mouse dorsal air sac model was dose-dependent, and 100 mg/kg of roxithromycin administered intraperitoneally twice a day reduced the dense capillary network area to about 20% of the control. Administration of roxithromycin histologically reduced the development of microvessels and mononuclear cell infiltration. In vivo tumor growth studies demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of roxithromycin at 20 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day reduced tumor size of B16BL6 melanoma to about 56% and 33% (experiment 1), 71% and 48% (experiment 2) of that in the respective controls. Roxithromycin also significantly inhibited pulmonary metastasis of B16BL6 cells in a spontaneous system. The inhibitory activities of roxithromycin on angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis were compared with those of a potent angiogenesis inhibitor, TNP-470. These data demonstrated that roxithromycin has potent antiangiogenic and antitumor effects and might have possible therapeutic applications.",include
3473257,Protective effect of beta-carotene against colon tumors in mice.,"The effect of dietary beta-carotene on colon carcinogenesis induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine [(DMH) CAS: 540-73-8] was studied in female inbred Swiss Webster (ICR) mice. At age 10 weeks and continuing throughout the experiment, mice received diets consisting mainly of natural foods (laboratory chow) and containing 2 or 22 mg beta-carotene/kg. At age 15 weeks they received 7 weekly sc injections of DMH (total dose: 196 mg DMH X diHCI/kg body wt). When autopsied 31 weeks after the first DMH injection, the incidence (percent of mice with tumors) and multiplicity (number of tumors/tumor-bearing mouse) of colon tumors were reduced by half in the mice supplemented with beta-carotene. There was a much greater decrease in adenocarcinomas than in adenomas. Mice observed for 13 additional weeks revealed that the mortality rate, due largely or wholly to colon cancer, was only about half in supplemented mice. Mice sacrificed 12 weeks after the first dose of DMH (i.e., well before tumors appeared) showed mild colon mucosal hyperplasia. beta-Carotene supplementation, however, did not alter this, indicating that the protective effect against colon cancer may have occurred at a late stage of carcinogenesis.",exclude
27773734,Liposomal prednisolone inhibits tumor growth in a spontaneous mouse mammary carcinoma model.,"Cancers are abundantly infiltrated by inflammatory cells that are modulated by tumor cells to secrete mediators fostering tumor cell survival and proliferation. Therefore, agents that interfere with inflammatory signaling molecules or specific immune cell populations have been investigated as anticancer drugs. Corticosteroids are highly potent anti-inflammatory drugs, whose activity is intensified when targeted by nanocarrier systems. Liposome-targeted corticosteroids have been shown to inhibit tumor growth in different syngeneic murine tumor models as well as human xenograft mouse models, which is attributed to a switch in the tumor microenvironment from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory state. Despite the recognized value of implantation tumor models in preclinical research, the ""acute"" inflammation induced by inoculation of tumor cells together with the exponential tumor growth in a relatively short period of time does not resemble slow progressive human disease that develops in situ. Therefore, in this study, the antitumor effect of liposomal corticosteroids was investigated in a clinically more relevant setting of transgenic mice developing spontaneous breast carcinomas. Here we show that liposomal prednisolone phosphate inhibits the growth of spontaneous breast carcinoma. Interestingly, the liposomal prednisolone was significantly more active than free drug. At 72h after injection of the liposomal formulation, 3Œºg prednisolone per gram of tumor tissue was recovered whereas no drug could be recovered after injection of the free agent. This indicates that, despite etiological and morphological differences between implanted and spontaneous tumor models, EPR-mediated accumulation of drug occurs to similar extent in this spontaneous mammary carcinoma model as in the syngeneic tumor models. Finally, we analyzed miRNA profiles in the MMTV/neu model and showed that the top 10 of miRNAs in the MMTV/neu tumor consisted of miRNAs with a known involvement in breast carcinoma proliferation and metastasis. The only exception was the appearance of miR-146b, a known inflammation-regulating miRNA species, after liposomal prednisolone treatment.",exclude
