# Name it and Explain it - An [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/) [TechTogether Boston 2020](https://boston.techtogether.io) Hackathon Project

## Introduction
This project is specifically designed for the [TechTogether Boston 2020](https://boston.techtogether.io) held from January 31 - Feb 2, 2020 in Agganis Arena, Boston University.

### Note to participants
If you are not clear about any particular concept as discussed below, please ask your technical mentors to help you. You can choose to finish the project using whatever programming language you are comfortable with, be it Python, Javascript, Go, R, Matlab, Mathematica, JAVA, C/C++, or whatever. 

## Motivation

Finding a good name for a new project (or product) is important as this is closely related to branding and gives a sense of identity, uniqueness, and sometimes history. 

But what constitutes a **good** name for a project may be hard to define as it may depend on the purpose, as there are multiple facets about a good naming, such as communicate the vision and purpose of the project, or the value proposition, benefits and features. A good reading is on this subject is [Igor’s Naming Guide](https://www.igorinternational.com/process/igor-naming-guide_17.pdf).

Although it's hard to precisely define what a **good** project name looks like, most people will be able to recognize it when they see it. Here are some well known project name examples.

## Goals

As you can see, coming up with a good name takes a lot of deep understanding about the natural languages and the nuances of languages. In this project, we want you to develop an AI solution to automatically come up with a **good** name for a project, where the project is described by a paragraph of text in whatever content a project manager would like to see. The AI solution will take that project description as input, suggest the a **good** name, and explain why such a name is chosen. The last step is also fashionly called *explainable AI* (**XAI**).

Here is a good example taken from an online blog by the [ProjectManager website](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/top-ten-project-code-names) about Verizon Communication's project, called **Hanks**, to represent the project where Verizon Communications was looking to take over AOL. In order to keep the projet secret while communicate some nature of this deal, *Project Hanks* is chosen as the name. This may not seem to make sense until you were reminded that [Tom Hanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hanks) starred in the movie [You’ve Got Mail (1998)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128853/), which is "a romantic comedy about a relationship built on AOL’s famous mail notification".

Using the same example for the AI solution you are going to build, you can consider that the project description is given as:

> Verizon Communications was looking to take over AOL

The output of your AI solution is:

> Project Hanks

The explanation of your AI solution would be something like:

> [Tom Hanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hanks) starred in the movie [You’ve Got Mail (1998)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0128853/), which is "a romantic comedy about a relationship built on AOL’s famous mail notification".

## Tasks

### Required tasks (must do)

Here are a few tasks that you must do:



### Advanced tasks (optional)


### Even more advanced tasks (optional)



## What to submit at the end of hacking

At the end of hacking, each team is required to submit the following materials to the IBM judges: 

- A link to your project repository with completed source codes on [github.com](github.com), including  a README.md file that instructs people how to repeat your results (what steps to run in order to obtain results for which task).
- A presentation file (either PPT or HTML webpage or Words or PDF or whatever you like) that documents your findings, rationals, and conclusion. This should contain enough details for people to judge the quality of your final project deliverables. Please include your presentation file in your project repository. 

The submission is done by creating a [new issue](https://github.com/JinjunXiong/TechTogether2020/issues) within this TechTogether2020 challenge's github repostiory. Name the title of the issue with your **team name**, and in the body of the issue, please include **name(s) of your team members** and the **link** to your project repository.

A [sample submission issue](https://github.com/JinjunXiong/TechTogether2020/issues/1) has been created for your reference. Please follow the same template. 

Please check out [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for ways to create a simple webpage to promote your project.

Some selected teams may be asked to make a presentation on their project findings as well. This will be decided after all submissions are done and before the final announcement of the winners.

## Judging criteria

Here are a few things we're looking for when judging the submissions:

- The quality of codes to accomplish the tasks
- The number of tasks accomplished
- The quality of ways to show the task results - including convincing data, plots, visualization
- The clarity of the presentation

## Prizes, Prizes, and Prizes

Of course there will be prizes for the top winners! We will select up to **top 4 winners**, each of which will not only be awarded with an awesome IBM Watson [TJBot](https://ibmtjbot.github.io/) that you can do amazing things with using the latest AI technologies, but most importantly, a summer internship with our coolest [IBM T.J. Watson Research Center](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/index.shtml). Or if you're close to graduate, we'll arrange an onsite job interview for you.
